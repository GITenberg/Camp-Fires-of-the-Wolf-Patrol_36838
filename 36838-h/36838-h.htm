<div class='adtitle1'>I. The <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Campfires'">Camp Fires</ins> of the Wolf Patrol</div>

<div class='blockquot'>Their first camping experience affords the scouts splendid opportunities
to use their recently acquired knowledge in a practical way.
Elmer <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Chenoweth'">Chenowith</ins>, a lad from the north-west woods, astonishes
everyone with his familiarity with camp life. A clean, wholesome
story every boy should read.</div>


<div class='adtitle1'>II. Woodcraft; or, How a Patrol Leader Made Good</div>

<div class='blockquot'>This tale presents many stirring situations in which some of the
boys are called upon to exercise all their ingenuity and unselfishness.
A story filled with healthful excitement.</div>


<div class='adtitle1'>III. Pathfinder; or, The Missing Tenderfoot</div>

<div class='blockquot'>Some mysteries are cleared up in a most unexpected way, greatly to
the credit of our young friends. A variety of incidents follow fast,
one after the other.</div>


<div class='adtitle1'>IV. Fast Nine; or, a Challenge From Fairfield</div>

<div class='blockquot'>They show the same team-work here as when in camp. The
description of the final game with the team of a rival town, and the
outcome thereof, form a stirring narrative. One of the best baseball
stories of recent years.</div>


<div class='adtitle1'>V. Great Hike; or, The Pride of The Khaki Troop</div>

<div class='blockquot'>After weeks of preparation the scouts start out on their greatest

and amusing situations.</div>


<div class='adtitle1'>VI. Endurance Test; or, How Clear Grit Won the Day</div>

<div class='blockquot'>Few stories "get" us more than illustrations of pluck in the face of
apparent failure. Our heroes show the stuff they are made of and
surprise their most ardent admirers. One of the best stories Captain
Douglas has written.</div>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>IN CAMP ON THE SWEETWATER.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">A troop</span> of khaki-clad boys had been marching, rather
wearily perhaps, along a road that, judging from all indications,
was not very much used by the natives.</p>

<p>The afternoon was waning, so that a summer's night
would soon begin to close in around them. Dense woods
lay in all directions, the foliage of which had afforded very
pleasant shelter from the fierce rays of the August sun.
"Halt!" came the loud order.</p>

<p>"Hurrah! we're going into our first camp, fellows!"</p>

<p>"Is that so, Mr. Garrabrant?"</p>

<p>"Pull off your lids, boys, and give a salute!"</p>

<p>"What a dandy old place for a camp. How d'ye suppose
he came to pick this out, Elmer?"</p>

<p>"That's as easy to tell as falling off a log, Toby. We
have to use water to cook with; and just notice this fine
stream running past us," returned the boy addressed, who
seemed to be the second in command of the detachment of
scouts. "Besides," he added, "you forget that we aimed
to reach the Sweetwater River by evening, so that we could
start up the current in our boats to-morrow morning. And
this, I reckon, is the stream that we're looking for."</p>

<p>"Hurrah again, fellows! The day's hike is done. Now
for a bully rest!"</p>

<p>"Stand at attention, all! Call the roll, secretary, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
see if there are any stragglers!" the scout master commanded,
as the small troop ranged up before him.</p>

<p>This young man was Mr. Roderic Garrabrant, who had
only too gladly assumed the r&ocirc;le he occupied, being greatly
interested in the boy problem; and possessing a few fads
and fancies he wished to work out by actual experience.
His knowledge of woodcraft was not so very extensive; but
the moral effect of his presence was expected to exert
considerable benefit in connection with the dozen or more
members of the Hickory Ridge troop of Boy Scouts.</p>

<p>The small town of Hickory Ridge lay about seven miles
due south of the place where they had struck the winding
Sweetwater; and the party had tramped this distance since
noon. While it might not seem very far to those who
are accustomed to long walks, there were a number among
the scouts who had undoubtedly exceeded their record on
this same afternoon.</p>

<p>An exceedingly tall and ungainly lad, with long legs
that seemed to just delight getting in the way at times,
threatening to twist him in a knot, drew out a little pocket
volume, and in a sing-song tone started to call off numerous
names.</p>

<p>Each boy answered promptly when he heard his own
name mentioned; and as they will very likely figure largely
in our story, it might be just as well to take note of the
manner in which Arthur Stansbury called them off:</p>

<p>"Members of the Wolf Patrol: Elmer Chenowith, Mark
Cummings, Ted Burgoyne, Toby Ellsworth Jones, Arthur
Stansbury, and Chatz Maxfield.</p>

<p>"Members of the Beaver Patrol: Matty Eggleston, Oscar
Huggins, Tyrus Collins, Jasper Merriweather, Tom
Cropsey, Lawrence Billings.</p>

<p>"Unattached, but to form Numbers One and Two of the
new Eagle Patrol: Jack Armitage and Nathan Scott."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>"We seem to be just two shy," observed Mr. Garrabrant,
with a twinkle in his eye, as he turned toward Elmer
Chenowith, who had recently received his certificate
as assistant scout master from the National Council, and
was really qualified to take the place of the leader whenever
the latter chanced to be absent.</p>

<p>Elmer raised his hand promptly in salute, as he made
reply:</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; Nat Scott and Jasper Merriweather. They
pegged out a mile or so back; and after examining their
feet, and finding that they were really sore from walking,
I gave them permission to ride on the commissary wagon,
sir."</p>

<p>Now, of course Mr. Garrabrant knew all this perfectly
well. He had actually watched the pair of tenderfeet
only too gladly clamber aboard the wagon that bore the
tents, food, extra clothing, and cooking outfit for the
camp. But thus far did military tactics rule the Boy
Scouts, that he was supposed to know nothing about such
incidents until they had been reported to him in the proper
manner, as provided for in the system.</p>

<p>"Suppose then you notify them, Mr. Bugler," said the
scout master, turning to Mark Cummings, who, besides
being the especial chum of Elmer, was really a fine musician,
and naturally had been unanimously chosen as bugler
for the new troop of scouts recently organized in Hickory
Ridge.</p>

<p>When the clear, penetrating notes of the bugle sounded
through the neighboring woods, there came a faint but
enthusiastic cheer from some point along the back trail. In
addition, the waiting scouts could catch the plain creaking
of a wagon, accompanied by encouraging words, spoken
undeniably by a "gentleman of color."</p>

<p>"Git up dar, youse ol' sleepy-haid, Andy Jackson! Wot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
youse t'ink we's gwine tuh do up hyah in dis neck ob de
woods, hey? Git a mobe on yuh, Jawdge Washington!
Jes' quit dat peekin' outen de tail end ob yuh eye at me!
We ain't playin' dat ere game ob politics now; dis am
real, honest, sure-nuff work. Altogedder now, bofe ob
youse; or de waggin dun stick in de mud of dis crick!"</p>

<p>Then followed a few whacks, as the energetic driver applied
the goad, some startled snorts, in turn succeeded by
another relay of faint cheers from the two footsore scouts
aboard the wagon.</p>

<p>And presently the lumbering vehicle, with its sweating
steeds, halted alongside the site selected by the scout master
as the spot for the first camp of the scouts' outing. An
opening was readily found where Ginger, the ebony driver,
might urge his reluctant team to leave the hard road, and
enter among the trees.</p>

<p>Immediately a scene of great bustle, and more or less
confusion ensued; for it must be remembered that while
the Hickory Ridge scouts may have drilled in the work
of starting a camp, that was only theory, and the present
was their first actual practice on record.</p>

<p>The contents of the wagon were overhauled, and several
tents started to go up on spots particularly selected by the
leaders of the patrols, who had this duty in their sole
charge.</p>

<p>Here Elmer had a great advantage over all his fellows,
since he had spent much of his life up in the Canadian
Northwest, where his father had held a position as manager
to extensive lands that were being farmed on a colossal scale,
until a year or so previous, when, being left a snug little
fortune, Mr. Chenowith had decided to return to his native
state, to settle down for the balance of his days.</p>

<p>Of course the boy had picked up a considerable amount
of useful knowledge during his stay in that country of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
vast distances, which was likely to prove of use to him in
his experiences as a scout.</p>

<p>They had elected him as president of the troop, and he
had readily been given the position of scout leader in the
Wolf Patrol because of this wide range of knowledge pertaining
to the secrets of outdoor life. It had also been
mainly instrumental in securing for him the coveted certificate
from Headquarters, recognizing him as a capable
assistant to Mr. Garrabrant.</p>

<p>Elmer could toss a rope, follow a trail, throw a "diamond
hitch" in loading a pack horse, travel on snowshoes, recognize
most wild animals just from their tracks, make a
camp properly, and do so many other like tricks that made
him the envy of his mates, and especially Matty Eggleston,
who was the leader of the Beaver Patrol, and had much
to learn concerning his duties.</p>

<p>It was a cheerful scene, as the tents were raised, and
fires began to crackle, one for each patrol, according to
custom. Even the two limping scouts forgot their recent
lameness, and began to sniff the air hungrily when Ginger
started to get supper for the crowd.</p>

<p>Ginger had qualified as an expert first-class cook, but
the truth might as well be stated right in the beginning
that the boys quickly tired of the greasy messes the son
of Ethiopia flung together, and soon followed the example
of the Wolf Patrol, doing their own cooking, an arrangement
that pleased the good-natured but indolent Ginger
perfectly. He was always on hand, however, when the time
for eating came around, being possessed of an enormous
appetite that alarmed Mr. Garrabrant more than a little.</p>

<p>Night had closed in long before supper was ready, for
things somehow worked at sixes and sevens on the occasion
of the getting of the first meal, since many essential articles
had to be hunted for, entailing a loss of time. But all this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
would be remedied as soon as they were in their permanent
camp, for both Mr. Garrabrant and Elmer were keen on
system and order.</p>

<p>The boys were almost famished after that seven-mile hike,
and could hardly wait for the signal to "fall to." But
there was an abundance for all, and none of them was much
inclined to be what Arthur Stansbury called "finicky"
that night.</p>

<p>Mr. Garrabrant, however, while eating, looked suspiciously
toward Ginger, and shook his head in the direction of
Elmer, as if to say that if this mess were a fair specimen
of the cook's best efforts along the culinary line, the
sooner they started in to depend on themselves the better
for their digestion.</p>

<p>After the meal had been finished the boys left Ginger
to clean up while they lay around, enjoying the sparkling
blaze, something that most of them were not very familiar
with. For the time being all formality was thrown aside,
and they laughed and chatted, just as normal boys are
prone to do when out upon a holiday jaunt.</p>

<p>Mr. Garrabrant showed the two laggards how they had
been unwise not immediately to dislodge sundry small pebbles
that had found a way to get in their shoes, with the
consequence that presently stone bruises had formed that
became painful. He made them easy with some lotion he
carried for just such a purpose.</p>

<p>In this and dozens of other ways the efficient scout
master expected to teach the boys of the troop how to take
care of themselves when away from home. But the lads
who had to be told <i>the same thing twice</i> might expect to
forfeit some privilege since they were expected to think
for themselves, after being shown.</p>

<p>There was also a second colored man along, who expected
to take the team back on the morrow, since the scouts would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
have no further need of it, once they embarked in the
boats that were to meet them here. In these they expected
to ascend the Sweetwater to a small lake called Jupiter;
and from thence by way of Paradise Creek find a passage
to Lake Solitude beyond, where they meant to camp and
learn the numerous "stunts" a good scout should know.</p>

<p>Some of the lads had fair voices, and school songs were
sung around the fire, Mark doing the accompanying with
soft notes on his bugle. He had mastered this instrument,
and his mates never wearied of hearing him play.</p>

<p>Ted Burgoyne was afflicted with a slight lisp that gave
him no end of trouble; though he always insisted that he
spoke as correctly as any of his companions. Ted had a
strong leaning toward the profession of a surgeon, and indeed
was forever loudly wishing for a subject upon whom
to operate. The boys had considerable fun over this weakness,
but all the same they must have felt more or less
confidence in his ability to do the right thing; for whenever
any slight accident occurred it might be noticed that
every one in camp called upon "Dr. Ted" to take hold;
and he nearly always proved himself equal to the occasion.</p>

<p>Charlie Maxfield, or Chatz as he was universally called,
was somewhat of a queer chap. He believed in ghosts, and
was always reading stories of hobgoblins and haunted
houses. Of course, with such a propensity, Chatz could
be depended on to try and frighten his chums from time to
time. He was forever "seeing things" in the dark.</p>

<p>The rest of the boys had plenty of fun with Chatz, which
he took in good part; but although, as a rule, his alarms
proved to be false ones nothing seemed to disturb his deep-rooted
convictions. They even said he carried a rabbit's
foot, for good luck, the animal having been killed by Chatz
himself in a graveyard, and in the full of the moon.</p>

<p>Needless to say Chatz Maxfield was a Southern-born lad,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
as his accent alone proved. He was a fine fellow, taken
as a whole, outside of this silly belief in ghosts, which he
possibly imbibed from the small darkies with whom he
played on his father's Georgia plantation, years back.</p>

<p>"I don't see any boats around here, fellows!" remarked
Ty Collins, when there came a little lull in the conversation,
after Mr. Garrabrant had been explaining some puzzling
matter that one of the boys had put up to him.</p>

<p>"Why, that's a fact!" exclaimed "Lil Artha," as the
long-legged secretary, Arthur Stansbury was called by his
mates&mdash;he was a devoted amateur photographer, and even
then had been busying himself with some part of his equipment
as he sat by the fire.</p>

<p>Arthur was keenly desirous of learning all the various
kinks that a first class scout must know. He was somewhat
of a joker in his way, and at times a little addicted to the
use of current slang; but a warm-hearted, impulsive lad
all the same.</p>

<p>"They are to be on hand in the morning, boys," remarked
Mr. Garrabrant. "And of course we shall not
think of leaving here until they come. Make your minds
easy on that score, Nat and Jasper. Your heels will have
a chance to get well, never fear."</p>

<p>"Where's Chatz?" asked one of the other boys, suddenly.</p>

<p>"He asked permission to walk back a bit over our trail,"
observed Elmer. "Said he missed a buckle from his coat,
which he was carrying over his arm when he tripped. I
let him take a lantern with him to see if he could find it."</p>

<p>"Lil Artha" began to laugh, and several of the other
boys joined in.</p>

<p>"Oh! my! what if he happens to run across one of those
ghosts he's always talking about?" suggested Toby Ellsworth
Jones, whose grandfather had been a veteran, and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
soldier under the colonel who died at Alexandria, Va., in
the Civil War; whence the name of Ellsworth&mdash;Toby was
just wild on the subject of aeronautics; and while thus far
everything he attempted had proven as flat a failure as
the famous flying machine of Darius Green, still he lived
in hopes of accomplishing something that would make the
name of Jones renowned.</p>

<p>Several of the boys struggled to their feet at this, finding
themselves stiff in the legs after their long walk.</p>

<p>"Look! there's a light coming just flying along the road
right now!" cried Larry Billings.</p>

<p>"And that must be Chatz on the full run, though he
wouldn't yell out for anything!" exclaimed Mark.</p>

<p>"Something must be chasing him, fellows!" declared
Toby, in great excitement.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's a wildcat!" suggested Jasper Merriweather,
who was a bit timid.</p>

<p>"Here he comes, and he can speak for himself. What
ails you, Charlie; what happened to start you running?"
asked the scout master, as the boy came hurrying up, breathing
hard, and showing signs of positive alarm.</p>

<p>"Reckon I saw something, suh, that was mighty mysterious!"
replied Chatz; at which the entire group of scouts
looked at each other, and held their breath in awe.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE SUDDEN PERIL.</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">I see</span> you found your buckle, Chatz," remarked Elmer,
noticing what the other was holding in the hand that was
not occupied in grasping the lighted lantern.</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, I picked that up where I tripped, and nearly
fell flat," replied the other, quickly. "Just as I got up
off my knees I happened to look alongside the road, where
the trees grow so thick, and I give you my word, fellows,
I saw a moving white figure that had the most terrible yellow
eyes ever! I know you all laugh at me whenever I
say I believe in ghosts; but if that wasn't one I miss my
guess, yes suh."</p>

<p>"I'll dare you to go back with me till we find out," said
Elmer, quickly.</p>

<p>Chatz hesitated; but for all his silly notions in this one
line the boy was far from being a coward.</p>

<p>"All right, if you say so, I'm willing," he declared.
"I'd just like to know what that was, anyhow, if not a
specter. Come on, Elmer."</p>

<p>"Take me along, won't you?" asked Lil Artha, gaining
his feet, as he thrust his kodak away.</p>

<p>"Me, too!" called out several others; while a few hung
back, not caring to take chances of a meeting with a real
ghost.</p>

<p>"You can go along, Arthur, likewise Ted and Toby. The
rest had better stay here with me to guard the camp, in case<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
there happens to be a raid of ghosts," remarked the scout
master, in a tone that put an end to all protestations.</p>

<p>So the little party trotted off, followed by wishful glances
from the balance of those who would have liked to be with
them.</p>

<p>Down the road they went, Chatz keeping in close contact
with Elmer, and maintaining a discreet silence. Presently
they arrived at the spot where he had found the missing
buckle.</p>

<p>"Here's where I stooped down to hunt, boys," he remarked,
in a low voice; "and when I looked over yonder,
I saw IT standing just back of that fringe of brush, waving
its long arms at me, and staring to beat the band. Do you
see anything there, fellows?"</p>

<p>"Not a thing, Chatz," replied Artha, cheerfully. "To
the foolish house for you!"</p>

<p>"What's that?" said Toby, holding up his hand, suddenly.</p>

<p>"Did you see anything move?" demanded the Southern
lad, eagerly, as though he wanted to prove that his alarm
had been well founded.</p>

<p>"I thought I did," replied Toby, quivering with eagerness.</p>

<p>"Listen, fellows," observed Elmer, with a chuckle.</p>

<p>From somewhere back in the woods there came a weird
sound, mournful enough to strike a chill to the heart of
anyone not familiar with its nature.</p>

<p>"Oh! whatever can that be?" cried Toby. "Sounded
just like some poor feller calling for help."</p>

<p>"Elmer, you know; tell uth, pleath!" entreated Ted,
with his usual lisp, which even the alarm that was seizing
hold of him now could not dissipate.</p>

<p>"Well, I declare, I'm surprised to think that none of you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
fellows ever heard an owl hoot before!" laughed the scout
leader of the Wolf Patrol.</p>

<p>"An owl&mdash;that only a poor little dickey of an owl!"
cried Toby.</p>

<p>"Yes, it sounds just like the white owl we used to have
up in Canada," continued Elmer, seriously. "And ten to
one now, it was what Chatz here saw in that brush alongside
the road. Of course it had staring yellow eyes; and in
the dim light he must have fancied he saw an arm waving
at him. That was only a shadow, Chatz. So come along,
let's get back to the fire."</p>

<p>"Well, anyway, it looked mighty spooky," declared the
Southern boy, stubbornly.</p>

<p>And he persisted in this attitude, even when some of his
companions, who might not have been one half so brave
as Chatz, if ever put to the test, began to "josh" him
because of his recent alarm.</p>

<p>Mr. Garrabrant, accompanied by Elmer, went the rounds
to ascertain just how the boys had erected their tents. He
found little cause for complaint, since the young assistant
scout master had drilled the members of the troop in this
science, and they had it down quite pat, at least so far as
theory went.</p>

<p>While the Boy-Scout movement of to-day has little to
do with military tactics, still discipline is taught; and
numerous things that soldiers employ in their daily life are
practiced. One of these is setting a guard at night, and
teaching the boys the necessity of keeping watchful when
in the woods.</p>

<p>Each patrol had to set a guard or sentry, and lay out
a plan whereby the various members would take turns in
standing duty during some period of the night.</p>

<p>The two unattached scouts were temporarily added to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
six composing the Wolf Patrol, so that they might come
under the charge of Elmer, and profit from his instruction.</p>

<p>By ten o'clock the camp had relapsed into a condition of
silence. "Taps" had been sounded on the bugle, which
meant that every light must be extinguished except the two
fires; and each scout not on duty seek his blanket.</p>

<p>Of course there was more or less whispering from time
to time; and apparently it was a hard thing for some of
the boys to settle down to sleep. But both Mr. Garrabrant
and Elmer knew boy nature full well, and for this one
night were disposed to overlook little infractions of the
rules. But later on they would expect to hold the entire
troop rigidly to discipline, when the time for skylarking
had gone by.</p>

<p>Elmer had left word with the boy from the Wolf Patrol
who first went on duty to awaken him if anything out of
the way occurred. And in turn he was to transmit the
order to the fellow who succeeded him.</p>

<p>When a hand gripped his arm as he lay under his blanket
Elmer was immediately awakened; nor did he evince the
slightest alarm.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked, softly, not wishing to arouse
the others in the tent, who were sound asleep, if their heavy
breathing stood for anything.</p>

<p>"Something moving on the river, and I thought you
ought to know," replied the one who had crept excitedly
under the canvas.</p>

<p>"All right, Toby, I'm coming after you. Back out!"
replied Elmer, as he wriggled from under his comfortable
blanket, and pulled on his trousers; for the air of an
August night often feels decidedly chilly, especially after
one has been snuggled beneath covers.</p>

<p>He found the fires had died down, though the boys made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
sure that they did not wholly go out, since they had no
great love for the darkness.</p>

<p>"Listen! There it goes again," remarked Toby, once
more clutching the sleeve of the scout leader in a nervous
hand.</p>

<p>Elmer chuckled.</p>

<p>"Well, this is a funny thing," he said, as though amused.
"First Chatz takes a poor old owl with its yellow eyes for a
ghost, and now you imagine the dip of oars to be something
as mysterious and thrilling. Why, don't you make out two
sets plashing at different times. Those are the boats we
expect. Perhaps the men from Rockaway down the river
were delayed; or else they preferred to do their rowing
after the sun set. But that's all it means, Toby."</p>

<p>"Aw! well, I thought it my duty to let you know," observed
the other.</p>

<p>"And you did quite right, Toby. But I'd better try and
get Mr. Garrabrant out here without awakening the lot, if
it can be done," and saying this Elmer started toward the
second tent, where the scout master had some four boys
under his especial charge.</p>

<p>It proved to be just as Elmer had guessed. The two men
who rowed the boats had preferred to do their work after
the heat of day had gone by. They would not even pass
the balance of the night in camp, being anxious to get back
to Rockaway, the town some five miles down the river.</p>

<p>So this little excitement died away, and once more silence
brooded over the camp on the Sweetwater. The night
passed without any further alarm; and with the coming
of morning the clear notes of the bugle sounding the reveille
aroused the last sleepers, and caused them to crawl
forth, rubbing their eyes and yawning.</p>

<p>Mark's grandfather had been a famous artist, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
boy bade fair to some day follow in his illustrious footsteps.
He was forever drawing exceedingly apt pictures, with
pencil, a bit of chalk, a scrap of charcoal or anything that
came handy; and as a rule these were humorous caricatures
of his chums in many amusing attitudes. So he now busied
himself catching the sleepy scouts in various striking postures,
to the great delight of those who gathered around.</p>

<p>Between Mark's readiness with the crayon and the eagerness
of Lil Artha to use his camera, it seemed likely that
little worth remembering would escape being handed down
to illustrate the events of this, their first outing.</p>

<p>"Me for a bully good swim!" exclaimed the long-legged
boy, as he started for the nearby river.</p>

<p>Others were quick to follow his example, for few healthy
boys there are to whom the opportunity for splashing in
the water on a summer morn does not appeal.</p>

<p>"Keep on your guard, fellows!" called Mr. Garrabrant,
who was busily employed doing something near one of the
tents. "The current is swift, and unless I miss my guess
the river is quite deep here. Elmer, you go along and watch
out that no one comes to harm," and he turned once again
to his task, confident that his assistant was capable of executing
his wishes properly.</p>

<p>Ten minutes passed away, and Mr. Garrabrant, having
managed successfully to complete the little job he had set
himself to execute, was thinking it time the boys who were
bathing should be recalled, when he heard sudden cries
that pierced him like an arrow.</p>

<p>"Hey! look at Jasper, would you, how funny he acts!"</p>

<p>"Elmer! Elmer! come here! Jasper's got a cramp!
He's gone down!"</p>

<p>Hurriedly did the alarmed scout master leap to his feet
and start wildly in the direction of these loud outcries. No<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
doubt in that second of time he saw the faces of the Merriweather
boy's parents, filled with the agony that comes to
those who have lost a son by drowning; and the mental
picture sent Mr. Garrabrant flying over the ground.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>GINGER PLAYS WITH FIRE.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the time the loud cries had come, Elmer was just leaving
the water himself, having had enough of a morning
bath. He saw several of the boys running toward a point
down stream, where Ty Collins and Nat Scott were when
they shouted, and without wasting a second Elmer had sped
that way.</p>

<p>So fast did he run that he easily outstripped the rest, and
reached the spot where Ty and Nat stood on the bank, beckoning
wildly to him, while they stared out upon the eddying
water.</p>

<p>One look Elmer gave. It enabled him to glimpse something
white emerging from the foamy water, and a pair of
arms beat wildly in the air. Then he sprang in, and hand
over hand made for the spot.</p>

<p>Luckily he had arrived just below, so that the chances
of his reaching the drowning lad were better than would
have otherwise been the case if he had the swift current
against him.</p>

<p>Perhaps in all his life Elmer Chenowith never struck out
with such intense eagerness, for he had seen that something
serious must have happened to Jasper, since he was under
the surface of the water most of the time and undoubtedly
gulping in great quantities of it.</p>

<p>Keeping his eyes fastened on the struggling figure as best
he could, Elmer made his way furiously through the surging
Sweetwater. Just at this place, on account of a decided<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
drop in the bed of the river, there was a swift current and
considerable foam around the rocks that partly blocked the
rapids.</p>

<p>"He's got him!" shrilled Tom Cropsey.</p>

<p>"But look out, Elmer; don't let him get a grip on you!
Size up the way Jasper is fighting to get hold of him! Oh!
he nearly did it, then! What ought we to do, fellows? If
he grabs Elmer they'll just both drown!"</p>

<p>It was Red Huggins who thus gave vent to his feelings.
He generally became so excited in an emergency that he
could not collect his wits enough to be of any great use.
And it was fortunate that all of those present were not
built upon the same model as impulsive Red.</p>

<p>Mr. Garrabrant had snatched up a rope as he ran. Perhaps,
with rare wisdom the long-headed scout master had
even placed it there, looking to a possible sudden need for
such a thing.</p>

<p>He had no occasion to ask where the thrilling event was
taking place. Every boy was staring in that one quarter,
and before he even saw the two figures in the swirl of the
yeasty river Mr. Garrabrant realized the condition of
affairs.</p>

<p>He found that Elmer had managed to seize the drowning
boy from behind, always the very best method of doing
in such a case. Had he been unable to accomplish this, and
the frenzied Jasper seized upon him, doubtless Elmer would
have broken away, even though he might have had to strike
the other quite sharply in the face and partly stun him
to do so. Better that, than that both should go down together.</p>

<p>So Elmer was endeavoring to push the other in toward
shore. Sometimes the water would go over them both with
a rush, for they happened to be in one of the roughest parts
of the river.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Garrabrant sized up the situation at a single glance.
Then he ran down the shore a dozen paces, and started to
wade into the river.</p>

<p>"Here, take hold of this end of the rope, boys!" he
cried, as he came upon several of the scouts who were standing
knee deep in the water, seemingly half paralyzed by
the terrible nature of the scene before them.</p>

<p>Mark Cummings had just arrived on the scene. He had
been dressing in the tent at the time the alarm sounded.
Regardless of the fact that he had on his clothes, he sprang
into the water alongside the scout master.</p>

<p>Together they buffeted the waves, and made for the approaching
pair. Elmer saw them coming and redoubled his
efforts to keep the drowning boy afloat, and at the same
time avoid being clasped in his desperate embrace.</p>

<p>Then friendly hands were laid upon them, and with three
to take charge, Jasper was borne to the land. He had collapsed
before the shore was reached, and the balance of
the boys gathered around, staring in great fear at his pallid
face.</p>

<p>Mr. Garrabrant knew the theory of restoring a person
who has come very near being drowned; but it chanced
that Elmer had more than once had active participation in
that sort of work. So he lost no time in stretching poor
Jasper, face down, on the ground, placing his knees on his
back, and having his arms worked regularly by some of
the boys, while he pressed downward, again and again with
considerable force, so as to induce artificial breathing.</p>

<p>As Jasper was not far gone he quickly responded to this
rough but effective treatment. He belched out a small
Niagara of water, groaned, trembled, and finally tried to
beg them to have a little mercy on him, saying that he was
now all right, upon which the boys of course ceased their
efforts intended to bring him to.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Breakfast was slow in coming along that morning.
Ginger had been tremendously unnerved by the exciting
spectacle of the rescue of the drowning lad, and he continuously
made all sorts of foolish blunders while trying
to cook, so that in the end Mr. Garrabrant chased him away
and set Elmer and Ty Collins at the job, both of whom he
knew were very good cooks.</p>

<p>Afterwards the tents had to come down, and the entire
outfit be stored away in the two boats which were intended
to carry them the balance of the way.</p>

<p>Ginger sent the horse and wagon back in charge of the
other colored man, and announced himself prepared to accompany
the troop into the heart of the wilderness. He
was so good-natured, and they could make use of him to do
much of the drudgery of the camp; so Mr. Garrabrant decided
to let Ginger go along, even though he was not to be
trusted to get their meals any longer.</p>

<p>The boats were stoutly built, and of a good size. Both
were capable of being rowed by two pairs of oars: and, indeed,
this was rendered quite necessary by the swiftness of
the Sweetwater in parts.</p>

<p>Once they reached the first little lake and the worst part
of the struggle would be over; after that the going must
prove much easier.</p>

<p>At first the scouts considered the rowing a picnic. That
lasted less than ten minutes. Then, as the strain of the current
started to tell upon them, grunts began to be heard, and
these were followed by heavy sighs and glum faces.</p>

<p>Blisters began to appear on palms that were quite unused
to labor of this severe kind. True, Mr. Garrabrant in one
boat, and Elmer in the other, tried to show the greenhorns
how they could save themselves much of this pain by proper
handling of the oars; but like everything else, experience
after all was bound to be the best guide.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>A number of the lads, however, were more or less familiar
with rowing, even though there was no body of water
close to the town on the railroad known as Hickory Ridge.
Of course Elmer himself took an oar, and kept up his part
of the drudgery from start to finish; and his chum Mark
also did his share with credit.</p>

<p>There were places where the river widened, and the current
was less savage. Here those who tugged at the oars
managed to rest up a bit for the next hard pull.</p>

<p>So the morning passed with frequent rests, for Mr. Garrabrant
knew better than utterly to weary his command in
the beginning. They were, after all, out for sport; and it
would have been an unwise move on his part to have sickened
the tenderfeet scouts before they had had a fair chance
to get hardened to it.</p>

<p>Just before noon the boy in the bow of the leading boat
gave a yell.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked the scout master.</p>

<p>"I just had a squint at a body of water, sir; and I think
it must have been a lake," replied Jack Armitage, who was
in the boat with the Wolf Patrol, Ginger working one of
the oars in the other craft.</p>

<p>"That must be the first lake, Jupiter they call it," Mr.
Garrabrant went on.</p>

<p>"Hurrah! that means a rest, and lunch, fellows!" cried
Lil Artha, who had been resting after his turn at rowing.</p>

<p>"Don't crow too soon," barked Toby, mysteriously.
"The worst is yet to come. Remember that these two lakes
are joined by Paradise Creek. I've heard that stream is
worse than the river here to pull against."</p>

<p>"That's where you're mistaken, Toby," remarked Elmer.
"I talked with a lumberman, and also a sportsman
who comes up here every fall to shoot wild ducks on the
lake they call Solitude. Both of them assured me that once<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
we got to this point our troubles would be over. So cheer
up, my hearties, the pulling will be a picnic after this."</p>

<p>Then they passed out from the head of the romantic
Sweetwater. The lake was a pretty little sheet of water,
with shores that, as a rule, were wooded; though in several
places it looked as though farms ran down to the water's
edge.</p>

<p>The boys soon clamored to get ashore and stretch their
weary legs; nor was Mr. Garrabrant in the least averse to
such a change himself. It is always inducive to cramp to
sit in a boat several hours.</p>

<p>Lunch was eaten under a patch of friendly trees that
grew on the bank. Then the troop was allowed half an
hour to lounge around, ere once more embarking for the
afternoon row.</p>

<p>Just where they had landed it was very wild. Rocks
jutted up out of the sides of the hills, and the trees grew
in every crevice where earth had gathered.</p>

<p>Toby was lying on his back, looking longingly up at the
bald top of a neighboring elevation that might almost be
called a mountain.</p>

<p>"Say," he said to Red, who happened to be sprawled
out near him, "did you ever in all your days see such a
splendid place as that for a starter? Just think what a jolly
good thing it would be to stand there on the edge of that
cliff and just give one big spring off, flapping your wings
as you jumped. Wow! I can see myself sailing through
space, and coming down as gently as a thistle ball. But
how could a fellow ever get up there in the first place?&mdash;that's
what's bothering me."</p>

<p>"Look here, Toby, you don't really mean to say that
if you had those silly old wings along with you, anything'd
ever tempt you to take such chances as to jump off that
high place? Why, it'd be your finish sure, if you ever did.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
You'd come down with an awful jar. And ten to one we'd
have to gather your poor remains up with a shovel. I'm
glad Mr. Garrabrant refused to let you fetch along all that
stuff you had laid out to bring."</p>

<p>"He near broke my heart when he said that, Red,"
sighed Toby. "But we're going to be up here some time,
you know, and perhaps I might get a chance to rig up some
sort of flying machine. I'll never be happy till I'm sailing
through the clouds, and that's a fact."</p>

<p>"Your heart, could stand it better than your blessed
neck," retorted Red. "And that's what would have happened
to you, sure, if he'd let you try to play your game
of being aviator to the troop."</p>

<p>"Sit still, fellows!" sang out the photographer just
then; "I've got you in just a dandy picture, the entire
bunch! There, done with a click, and thank you."</p>

<p>Mr. Garrabrant sat up and looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"About time we were moving, boys," he remarked, at
which there were numerous uplifted eyebrows, and not a
few groans, as the unfortunate tenderfeet looked at the red
spots in the palms of their hands, unused to hard work.</p>

<p>Of course, as there was little to pack, it would be a matter
of only a few minutes ere they could be on the move
again, and speeding up Jupiter Lake toward the link that
connected with the other sheet of water.</p>

<p>"All here?" asked Mr. Garrabrant, as a precautionary
measure; since some of the scouts had shown a weakness for
wandering whenever half a chance arose.</p>

<p>Elmer had just been in the act of counting heads.</p>

<p>"We seem to be one shy, sir," he remarked.</p>

<p>"It's Ginger," declared one of the scouts. "I noticed
him walking off some little time ago, sir. He told me somebody
said there was gold up in these mountains, and the
poor old silly was lookin' for signs of it, I guess."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"Give him a call on the bugle, Mark!" said Elmer, looking
annoyed; for it would be too bad if, after all their plans,
Ginger should take it into his head to delay them now by
getting lost.</p>

<p>So the bugler let out a blast that could easily be heard a
mile away. Then they one and all listened to discover if
any answer came floating back.</p>

<p>"I heahs yuh, suh," came the voice of Ginger from the
neighboring woods. "I'se jes' be'n havin' heaps o' fun
wid dis leetle snake hyah. Glory be, but he am de maddest
critter yuh eber see, a shaking ob his tail; an' de locust
asingin' in de tree."</p>

<p>"Keep away from him, Ginger!" shouted Elmer, jumping
up; "keep away from him, I tell you! My stars! that
must be a rattlesnake he's been playing with!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A NEVER-TO-BE-FORGOTTEN SUPPER.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">And</span> a rattlesnake it proved to be, sure enough!</p>

<p>When Elmer, followed helter-skelter by every one of
the others, drew near the spot where Ginger stood, with a
short stick in his hand, and now looking very much frightened
after hearing what a narrow escape he had had, they
discovered the angry poisonous reptile coiled, and buzzing
away at a great rate.</p>

<p>Locusts had been singing near by during the drowsy noon
hour, and that accounted not only for the common mistake
of the black man, but why none of the others had paid any
attention to the sound. Several remembered having heard
it, when their memory was jogged later.</p>

<p>Elmer quickly found a longer pole with which he assailed
the coiled terror of the rocky hills, and with a lucky
stroke he finally broke its back. All the boys crowded
around to look at the ugly thing, shuddering as they noted
its vicious fangs.</p>

<p>"Better look out, fellowth," warned Dr. Ted. "I've
heard they often hunt in coupleth, tho' there may be
another of the vermin near by!"</p>

<p>But a hasty search failed to reveal a mate to the dead
reptile. Mr. Garrabrant seized upon the occasion to read
a lecture to the scouts, telling them to live up to their motto,
"Be prepared," and always keep an eye out when in the
woods.</p>

<p>"That's one danger we must never forget up here," he
said; "and I've got a little phial I want every scout to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
carry along with him constantly. To-night I'm going to
explain just how to act in case any one of you finds himself
struck by a snake, which, however, I sincerely hope will
never happen, because they're nasty things at best, and
there's always a chance that the remedy may not work in
time to save the patient."</p>

<p>Ginger begged for the rattle, to serve as a reminder of
his narrow escape, and so Elmer cut it off for him.</p>

<p>"If I had time I'd like to skin the beast," the latter remarked,
"for he's beautifully marked, and would make a
nice tie, or a pocketbook. But in order to make a good job
I'd require an hour or more, and we don't want to carry
the thing along with us until night."</p>

<p>"Why do you say 'he' when you mention the rattler,
Elmer?" asked Mr. Garrabrant, who was not above seeking
new information from one who had been fortunate
enough to experience the actual realities of wild life.</p>

<p>"Well, you see that the skin has black diamond-shaped
marks on it. If it had been a female these would have been
more along a brownish order. At any rate, that's what
I've been told out where I met with these things frequently,"
Elmer stated.</p>

<p>"And I've no doubt but what you're quite right, Elmer,"
remarked the scout master. "I've noticed the same
thing in connection with quite a number of birds, the female
being coated a modest brown, whereas the male was
a lustrous black. But we must be moving. I'm glad, Ginger,
that it isn't necessary to practice on you for snakebite."</p>

<p>"Yas," muttered the black man, "an' de wustest t'ing
'bout de hull bizness am de fack dat dey ain't eben a
single drap ob snake pizen in de hull bilin crowd. So
'deed, I is right glad myself now dat de leetle critter didn't
git tuh me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>"And there goeth the only chance I've had this many a
day to get a little anatomical practice," Ted was grumbling;
though of course the boys understood that although
his manner of talk might seem so blood-thirsty, the amateur
surgeon was only joking.</p>

<p>But Ginger, after that, often watched Ted suspiciously
and refused to be left alone in camp with him.</p>

<p>Ten minutes of stout rowing brought them to the mouth
of Paradise Creek, where the waters from the other lake
emptied into Jupiter. Joyfully they started to navigate
these unknown regions. Elmer's boat was in the lead,
though for that matter not a single one in the party had
ever before been as far up the chains of waterways as
this.</p>

<p>When even the scout master realized that those who handled
the oars were becoming exhausted, he called a halt
and changed around, bringing fresh recruits forward. He
himself did yeoman service pulling, and Ginger also made
his muscles add considerable value to the progress of the
second boat.</p>

<p>"Dis am suah de t'ing tuh make de appatite," Ginger
kept saying, as he tugged away, with the perspiration rolling
down his black good-natured face. "Specks I done
want dubble rations dis berry night, Cap'n. De laborer
am worthy ob his hire, de good book say. An' dis am sartin
suah hard wuk."</p>

<p>As the afternoon slowly passed they realized that they
must be getting closer and closer to the second sheet of
water. Nobody was sorry. And when the sun hung over
the elevated horizon anxious looks began to be cast ahead.</p>

<p>Finally, almost without warning, the leading boat ran
out of the creek, passing around an abrupt bend, and a
shout of delight announced that the lake had been reached
at last.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>It was indeed well named. Solitude seemed to hang
over the whole picture, and if it could impress them in
this way while the sun was still shining, what gloom must
follow after the shades of night had fallen.</p>

<p>"Look around on this shore for a good site for a permanent
camp, Elmer," remarked the scout master, pointing
to the left. "I choose that because we will get some
shelter from the wind, in case of a sudden storm. Across
the broad lake it would be apt to hit us doubly hard. Am
I correct, Elmer?" Mr. Garrabrant went on.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the boy, quickly, "I should have
done just as you did, and I think I can see a good spot
for our camp; anyhow it looks that way from here. Give
way again, fellows, and I'll head the boat for our haven."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, and the two boats had been run ashore.
Then an eager troop of aching lads tumbled out, to stretch
themselves, and express delight over having finally reached
their goal. Quite a number of them had really never before
been away from home over night, so that it required
more or less assumption of gayety on their part to conceal
their real feelings. But by degrees these would grow accustomed
to the separation, and in the end it was bound
to make them more manly fellows.</p>

<p>Once again were the tents pitched. This time more care
was taken, for they anticipated a long stay, and ere breaking
camp for the return trip it was not unlikely that they
would be visited by one or more storms. So the stakes were
driven well in, and each tent had a little gulley dug around
the upper side, so as to turn water to the right and left in
case of a flood in the shape of a down-pour.</p>

<p>Other of the scouts started making fire-places from
the numerous stones. They had had practice along these
lines before now, closer at home, and the watchful eyes
of the scout leaders took note of everything that was being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
done. When they saw that matters were not going just as
cleverly as they could, a few words, perhaps a helping
hand, straightened out the difficulty.</p>

<p>By the time the sun passed beyond an outlying spur of
the mountain things began to take on a pretty decent look.
Several of the boys who were fond of fishing had been
set to work digging bait, and going in the boats to likely
spots pointed out by the experienced Elmer. Their excited
cries presently announced that there was some prospect of
the bill-of-fare that night having the magic name of
"trout" among the tasty food exhibit.</p>

<p>"And my word for it we'll need all we can get," laughed
Mr. Garrabrant aside to his assistant, as he nodded his head
to where Ginger was working lustily, and smacking his lips
as he kept one eye on the busy fisherman, "because Ginger
tells me he's awful fond of trout! It's going to keep me
hustling to supply all the appetites in this Camp Content
of ours; for they're developing most alarmingly."</p>

<p>But really Mr. Garrabrant was joking. He had foreseen
just such a condition as this, knowing boys as well as
he did, and made sure to add good measure to the quantity
of food first planned for.</p>

<p>The fishermen presently brought in what catch they had
made. Every one was both surprised and delighted to see
the splendid size of the trout that had taken the bait.</p>

<p>"Why, this sure is a great snap!" exclaimed Lil Artha,
who had been looking all around for various views which
he anticipated capturing on succeeding days. "We can
have the toothsome trout whenever the spirit moves, and
the fishermen get busy."</p>

<p>"And they pull like a house afire, too," declared Matty
Eggleston, who had been one of the anglers. "I've caught
black bass lots of times, but this is my first trout experience.
Yum, yum, say, don't they just smell fine, though?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Look at Ginger walking up and down over by the shore
of the lake! He's that near starved he just can't stay
around any longer and sniff that delicious odor! Boys,
ain't it near time to call us to the fray? Oh, I'm that
hollow I'm afraid I'll break in two!"</p>

<p>"Supper's ready, Mr. Garrabrant!" announced Ty Collins,
who had been given a free hand as chief cook on
this evening, while Elmer paid attention to various other
things.</p>

<p>"Call the boys in then, and we'll see if it tastes as good
as it smells. Sound the assembly, Mark," called the scout
master, himself not at all averse to the pleasant duty of
satisfying the inner man's clamorings.</p>

<p>So the bugler sent out the sweet call, and even Ginger
seemed to know what it meant, for he came hurrying along
to serve the dinner, a broad grin stamped on his ebony face,
and his mouth stretched almost from ear to ear.</p>

<p>"This is what I call solid comfort," observed Mark, as
he tasted the crisp trout, and decided that it was finer than
any fish he had ever eaten in all his life.</p>

<p>A chorus of approving grunts and nods followed his
assertion, for as a rule the scouts were too busily occupied
just then to say much. Ginger had not been compelled to
wait until they were through, under the existing conditions
that would have been next door to a crime, because the
poor old chap was really frantic for something to stop
the awful craving he had. So, after helping the entire
bunch he was allowed to dip in and sit in a retired spot,
where the tremendous champing noise he made while "feeding"
might not annoy the rest.</p>

<p>Afterward, when everyone admitted that "enough was
as good as a feast," they lay around taking things easy.
Ginger gathered up the cooking utensils, and the numerous
pannikins and tin cups used by the troop. It was to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
his duty to wash these things after each meal, and thus
the boys were enabled to avoid one very troublesome part
of camp life. And hence they were glad to have Ginger
along.</p>

<p>As before, arrangements were made looking to a constant
detail to serve as sentries. There was no danger anticipated,
of course, but since the scouts wished to learn everything
that was connected with life in the open, they must
carry out the game in all its parts. And guarding the
camp against a possible foe was one of these things.</p>

<p>Two were to be on duty at the same time, the entire night
being suitably divided up into watches, as on board a ship.
From ten o'clock up to five meant seven hour shifts, with
two boys on duty at a time.</p>

<p>Elmer and Mr. Garrabrant were exempt from this
drudgery if they so pleased, but the chances were, both
of them would obtain less sleep, that night at least, than
any of the others. Even Ginger was given his "spell,"
though it was doubted whether he could keep awake an
hour, for he was a very sleepy individual after he had finished
his task with the tin pans.</p>

<p>"To-morrow we start in with some of our tests," remarked
the scout master, as the time drew near for the bugler to
sound taps. "That's one thing I want to drill you boys
in, while we're up here. We'll pit the two details against
each other, and see which can set up a tent in the shortest
order, and in the best manner. Then we'll start on the
first-aid-to-the-injured racket, and take a step further than
we've ever gone before. After that I'm going to get our
assistant scout master to show us a lot of mighty interesting
things about following a trail, and what the different tracks
of such animals as may be found up here look like. And
another day some of us will hike to the top of that mountain,
while another detachment tries to climb the second<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
rise, after which they can wigwag to each other, in Signal
Corps language, and hold a long talk, to be verified later
on in camp from the records kept. That is the program,
boys. Now, go to your blankets and sleep over it."</p>

<p>They were as a rule a pretty tired lot that lay down.
The two sentries had to continue moving about to keep
from going to sleep on post, which might be considered a
serious offense, and lose them no end of good marks.</p>

<p>Twice did Elmer creep out of his tent, and make the
rounds in order to ascertain whether all were going well.
The last time was along about two in the morning, and
the first thing he heard was a whip-poor-will calling shrilly
to its mate not far away.</p>

<p>When he came upon Chatz, who had the outer post, he
was surprised to find him exhibiting all the well-known
signs by which he was wont to indicate that he had been
"seeing things" again. And knowing him so well, Elmer
hardly needed to ask what was the matter. Evidently the
ghosts that haunted Chatz must have been paying the superstitious
Southern boy another visit.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>WHAT WAS IT?</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">What</span> was it this time, Number Six?" asked the scout
leader, as Chatz turned quickly toward him, showing considerable
alarm.</p>

<p>"Oh! it's gone now. It just seemed to slide away while
I was looking. But I could hear it moving all the same;
and I tell you, honest Injun, that it was a dreadful <i>squashy</i>
sort of sound," and Chatz shrugged his shoulders with
what seemed to be a shudder, as he said this.</p>

<p>Elmer hardly knew what to do or to say. Chatz was
not above playing a joke, given the opportunity, but this
was really a subject on which he felt very deeply, so that
it was hard to believe he would be likely to hold it up to
scorn.</p>

<p>He seemed to be wide-awake, too, so that there was little
chance of its being a dream. Sensible on all other subjects,
the superstitious Southern lad had a decided weakness
for spooks, and he could imagine uncanny objects
prowling around where no one else found the slightest indication
of such a thing.</p>

<p>"Where was this?" Elmer asked, cautiously.</p>

<p>"Over there, in that open spot," replied Chatz, cheerfully
and without the least sign of hesitation. "You can
just make out the deeper shadow of the trees back further.
I was looking that way and thinking of something connected
with my home when all of a sudden IT loomed up, staring
at me in a frightfully ghastly way, and moving its white<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
body slowly up and down, just like it was warning me of
some coming danger."</p>

<p>"Sure it wasn't that owl again, are you?" questioned
Elmer, dubiously.</p>

<p>"Couldn't have been any such thing, because," triumphantly
went on Chatz, "you see, there ain't a single
chance for it to roost on anything! That place is bare!
I crossed it several times going for wood yesterday afternoon
before dark set in. And then besides&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, what else was there?" Elmer asked, encouragingly,
for he began to realize that there was at least no
fake about the other's upset condition.</p>

<p>"Why, it made the queerest noise you ever heard&mdash;just
a squashy sound that I'll never be able to forget. Ugh!
it was a nasty experience," and he rubbed his eyes with
his knuckles, after the manner of one just awakened.</p>

<p>Somehow this gave Elmer an idea.</p>

<p>"Look here, Number Six, are you sure now that you
weren't asleep, and just dreaming that something bobbed
up in front of you?" he demanded, sternly; for in his
capacity as assistant scout master he was given certain
privileges which the rest of the boys readily recognized.</p>

<p>"I don't think there's any reason to believe that sort
of thing," returned the other, steadily. "Fact is, I was
never more wide-awake in my life."</p>

<p>"And the thing just stood there, and waved at you,
did it?" Elmer continued.</p>

<p>"Oh! I know what you think about it, but when I see
a thing I can't deny it, can I? There was something close
to me a few minutes ago, something that must have been
a spook. If I hadn't had the good sense to stick my hand
in my pocket, and grab hold of that blessed old rabbit
foot, I honestly believe it would have jumped me! Now
laugh again if you want to," defiantly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>But Elmer was himself a bit puzzled. Of course he could
not think of allowing himself to dream that what Chatz
had seen could be anything unusual. The surrounding
conditions invested the most commonplace occurrence with
a mysterious atmosphere&mdash;that was all, and had it been
anyone but Chatz they might have found an easy explanation
for the puzzle.</p>

<p>"Well," the scout leader said, finally, "we'll all have
to borrow that lucky charm then, when we go on duty, if
it's going to scare the spooks away. But your time is up,
Number Six, so you can proceed to awaken the scout who
follows you."</p>

<p>"I'm glad, and I'm sorry," remarked Chatz. "To tell
the truth, I'd like to find out if that pesky thing <i>could</i>
crop up again. You see, there's no need of being scared
about it, so long as you've got something that keeps you
from getting hurt."</p>

<p>Evidently the belief of the Southern lad in that magical
rabbit's foot was firmly founded, and it would be exceedingly
difficult to uproot it. Sneers and scorn would never
accomplish that result; in fact such action was apt to only
make him cling the more stubbornly to his fetish worship.
Elmer believed in going about such things in another manner
entirely. Chatz must be shown the error of his ways;
and to do that most convincingly the real nature of the
object which he believed to be a ghostly visitant from the
other world, would have to be proven.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Number Six," he said, as the other was
about to head toward the tent where part of the Wolf
Patrol slept, so he could find and arouse his appointed successor.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Chatz; for, while Elmer was a chum
of his, there were times when he must recognize him only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
as a superior officer in the organization to which both belonged,
and show him due respect.</p>

<p>"Remember, not a single word to the scout who is to
succeed you," Elmer went on.</p>

<p>"Not a word will I breathe, sir, I promise you," replied
Chatz, and Elmer knew that nothing would tempt him to
betray his trust, for his sense of honor was very high, as
it is with all Southern boys.</p>

<p>"Perhaps we might get a pointer on this matter if the
strange thing you saw appeared to another," remarked
Elmer, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Oh! don't I just wish it would," remarked Chatz,
eagerly. "Then perhaps the rest of the fellows wouldn't
think me cracked in my upper story. And Lil Artha
wouldn't be so unfeeling as to say I had rats in my belfry,
He's the one who comes on after me. Don't I just wish it
would give him a <i>good</i> scare, though!"</p>

<p>"Well, go and wake him up, then. I'll let the other sentry
know that it's time for a change," and Elmer walked
away.</p>

<p>A sudden idea had flashed up in his mind. Could it be
possible that there was anything in this wild yarn of
Chatz's? Would the second sentry be able to throw any
light on the mystery?</p>

<p>He found him squatting on the ground, near a tree, and
saw that it was Jasper Merriweather, the timid boy of
the troop. At first Elmer had half a suspicion that the
other was asleep, for his head was bowed in his hands. At
the sound of his step, however, Jasper suddenly looked up
with a violent start, and Elmer saw that he was more or
less frightened, for he was shivering, even though he had
a blanket wrapped around his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Oh! it's you, sir, is it?" he exclaimed, and there was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
a positive vein of relief in the tones of his quivering voice
that Elmer could not but notice.</p>

<p>"Why, who else did you think it could be, Beaver, Number
Four?" asked the assistant scout master, quickly.</p>

<p>"Oh! I don't know," came the rather hesitating reply.
"You see I guess Chatz Maxfield has got me all worked
up with his silly notions, because I'm seeing things, just
like he does, right along. I'm ashamed of myself, that's
what."</p>

<p>"Do you mean just now you saw something?" asked
Elmer.</p>

<p>"Well," replied Jasper, rising to his feet as he spoke,
with returning confidence, "I thought I did, for a fact;
and I just hid my head to shut it out, but of course it was
only what Mr. Garrabrant calls an optical illusion. There
just couldn't be anything there."</p>

<p>"Of course not," the other went on, encouragingly.
"H'm, what was it, by the way, you <i>thought</i> you saw,
Number Four?"</p>

<p>"That's the silly part of it, sir," Jasper answered. "It
wasn't anything that I could recognize at all, which proves
that I was only imagining things. Plague take Chatz and
his ghosts! I never was very brave at my best, but thinking
of him has just about queered me. I'm glad you came
to talk to me, and show me how foolish it is to let such notions
take root."</p>

<p>"But, by the way, where was it you thought you saw
this wonderful thing which you say bore no shape that you
could describe?" Elmer insisted.</p>

<p>"Oh! let me see, I was sitting just this way, and looking
straight out yonder. It was in that open place, sir.
I guess the fire must have flashed up suddenly, and dazzled
me a bit."</p>

<p>But Elmer noticed that the second sentry pointed in exactly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the same quarter where Chatz insisted he had set eyes
on the ghost! This would seem to indicate that there must
be something in the story.</p>

<p>"Was it a flaming red ghost, Number Four?" he inquired
further.</p>

<p>"Why, of course not, sir," chuckled the other. "If it
had been I'd have thought it was only Ty Collins in that
red sweater he sometimes wears. Oh! no, what I <i>thought</i>
I saw was a white object. It seemed to be there when I
hid my face in my blanket, but when I looked a minute
later it was gone."</p>

<p>"Did you hear any sound?" Elmer demanded.</p>

<p>"Well, yes; but after all it may have been one of the
fellows snoring," Jasper replied. "But at the time I
thought it the queerest sort of noise ever. Might 'a' been
a big bulldog jumping into the water. I've heard something
like it when I pulled my foot out of a soft oozy piece
of mud."</p>

<p>"All right, Number Four. Your time is up, so go and
gently arouse your successor. And please don't even whisper
a word about this until I give you permission."</p>

<p>"Well, I guess I won't," Jasper quickly mumbled.
"Think I'm itching to have the laugh on me? No, siree,
I'm as dumb as an oyster," and with that he staggered off
toward one of the tents to awaken Nathan Scott.</p>

<p>Elmer returned to his blanket, but he had something on
his mind that kept him from enjoying any sound sleep
for the remainder of that particular night.</p>

<p>Those two boys had certainly seen <i>something</i>, and while,
of course, Elmer was too sensible a fellow to allow himself
to give the idea of a ghostly visitor the slightest credence,
he found himself puzzled to account for it all.</p>

<p>Because of his lying awake so long he slept later than
usual in the morning. True, he sprang up when the notes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
of the bugle sounded the reveille, but most of the others
had been abroad before him.</p>

<p>They took a dip in the lake, though the water was so
very cold that none of the scouts cared to remain in more
than five minutes. Besides, the almost tragic occurrence of
the previous day haunted some of them, and made them a
bit timid about venturing into the water, though by degrees
this fear would naturally wear off.</p>

<p>While preparations for breakfast were being undertaken
by those appointed for this purpose, Elmer strolled out
of the camp. He wished to carefully examine the open
patch of ground at the point where the two sentries had
been so positive the uncanny white object had appeared to
them.</p>

<p>Disappointment awaited him there, however. Numerous
footprints told how those of the scouts whose duty it was
to secure a fresh supply of firewood that morning had
passed back and forth directly across this open place. If
there had been any suggestive tracks they were surely
trampled out of sight by the army of boyish feet that had
gone over many times.</p>

<p>Elmer shook his head. He felt that he had been hoodwinked
in one sense, but no matter, even this setback must
not induce him to give up the task he had set for himself.
He owed it to Chatz and his infirmity to discover a reasonable
explanation of that ghost theory. And while the
solution might be delayed by this unfortunate trampling
of the ground, he meant to persist.</p>

<p>"Nothing doing, I guess?" remarked a voice close by,
and turning his head the scout leader saw Chatz himself
standing there, observing him with a quizzical expression on
his dark face.</p>

<p>"Well, if you mean an explanation of the little affair
of last night, Chatz, I admit that so far I'm up against it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
good and hard. You see, I hoped to find some marks here
that would give me a clue, but it's all off. The boys ran
after wood and back again so many times, that if there
was a trail it's been squashed."</p>

<p>"Oh! I don't think that mattered any," remarked the
other, with conviction in his tones. "You can't very well
discover what there isn't, can you? And I've always believed
that spooks never leave a sign behind them when
they come and go. Why, a spook is only a vapor, you know,
Elmer. They can slip through a keyhole if necessary. And
as to a trail, why, you might as well expect to see that cloud
up yonder leave a track behind it."</p>

<p>There could at least be no doubt about Chatz being in dead
earnest in his queer belief, and as Elmer turned away he
was more than ever determined to find the true solution
of that strange happening, if only to drive another nail
in the coffin of the Southern boy's superstition.</p>

<p>As neither of the sentries felt at liberty to mention the
occurrence until the assistant scout master gave permission,
the balance of the scouts ate their breakfast, and joked
each other, in blissful ignorance of the fact that the camp
had again been visited by a hobgoblin, and that this time
not only the superstitious Chatz but another had actually
seen the misty intruder!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE BOY SCOUTS' WATER BOILING TEST.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Garrabrant</span> was full of business on this fine morning.</p>

<p>He set about a host of things immediately after breakfast,
saying that they ought to take advantage of the opportunity
to get in a good morning's work.</p>

<p>Several boys were sent out on the lake to try to duplicate
the good luck attending the fishermen of the preceding
afternoon. Mark Cummings was encouraged to get numerous
views of the camp, and whatever was going on&mdash;such
as would afford the Hickory Ridge scouts the most
pleasure in later days, when this series of camp fires was
but a hallowed memory.</p>

<p>With the balance of the troop the scout master proceeded
to try out various interesting tests, to discover just how
the boys stood in the matter of efficiency. As Elmer was
such an old and experienced hand in most of these matters,
he was of course debarred from entering the competitions.
It would be taking too great an advantage over the tenderfeet
scouts, who had everything to learn as yet.</p>

<p>First of all the scout master decided to put ten boys
at the boiling-water test. This is one of the most interesting,
as well as amusing competitions, the scouts indulge
in, and one that never fails to evoke much laughter among
those who look on.</p>

<p>Each boy was given a tin pail that held two quarts of
water, and which could be carried by a bale. Besides this,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
he was handed just three matches, and put upon his honor
that he did not have another of the kind upon his person.</p>

<p>A spot was selected that was possibly fully eighty yards
away from the edge of the lake, and this Mr. Garrabrant
did purposely, so that if one of the competing scouts was
so unlucky as to upset his pail of water during the test, he
would be greatly handicapped by having to run so far in
order to replenish the same.</p>

<p>Lined up, they were to be given the word, when a rush
would be made for the lake, the buckets filled at least up
to a line midway that indicated a full quart. Then they
had to hasten back to the place assigned, being careful not
to spill a drop of the fluid on penalty of losing marks for
having less than the quart needed.</p>

<p>Wood had to be quickly gathered, and some sort of fire-place
constructed where a blaze must be started without the
aid of paper. Then the kettles were to be seated on the
stones, and the first one that had water actually boiling,
as witnessed by the scout master, would be the victor, and
the second called "runner-up."</p>

<p>"Ready, all!" called Mr. Garrabrant, and ten eager
pair of eyes watched him closely; "go!"</p>

<p>Immediately there was a race for the lake. One clumsy
scout fell down and had to scramble to his feet to take his
place at the tail end of the procession. Of course the
long-legged Lil Artha easily outran all his mates. He had
scooped up his water and was on the way back before the
next best arrived.</p>

<p>The wise ones made sure to dip up more than they really
needed, so as to make allowances for any that might be
spilled on the return flight. The surplus could be easily
tipped out before they set the kettle on the fire.</p>

<p>When the whole lot had finally reached the open spot
where the competition was to be carried out, the picture<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
was a lively one. Mark was on hand to take a few snapshots,
and catch all the humor of the scene.</p>

<p>Now Lil Artha had his fire going, being far in advance
of the others. As they hustled to get things moving it was
only natural that each fellow cast jealous glances toward
those who were getting along faster. In one instance that
caused the withdrawal of a competitor, for while paying
more attention to what Matty Eggleston was doing than
his own business, Larry Billings upset his kettle. After
that he gave up with a grunt, for it was the height of
folly for him to think of running to the lake for a fresh
supply.</p>

<p>Two others used all their three matches and failed to get
a fire started, so they also withdrew.</p>

<p>When Arthur Stansbury placed his kettle on his hastily
constructed fire-place, long before the rest, it looked as
though he had a "walkover."</p>

<p>All at once there arose a shout of boyish glee. In starting
to get to his feet, the long-legged one had, as frequently
happened, caught his ankles in a hitch, and throwing out
one hand to balance he upset the kettle, which came near
putting out his fire.</p>

<p>Mr. Garrabrant expected to see him leaping toward the
far-off lake in the hope of being yet in the running. To his
surprise, Lil Artha snatched up his pail and <i>ran away from
the edge of the water!</i> Several were so astonished at this
that they suspended operations for a second or two to stare
after him.</p>

<p>"Oh! I see what he's after, the sly fellow," laughed Elmer.
"He remembers the little stream that runs down the
side of the hill right there, and reaches the lake. It isn't
half as far away as the edge of the big water. Yes, there
he comes, with a grin on his face, and a full pail. Good
boy, Number Five!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Once back at his fire, now burning briskly, the tall boy
hastened to spill some of the contents of his kettle, and then
set the latter firmly on the stones. Nor did he stop there.
He had lost some ground, and several had by this time
succeeded in catching up with him. So down Arthur lay,
full on his stomach, where he could blow his fire, and
get it to burning more savagely, after which he fed it
with the best small pieces of splintered wood he had been
able to pick up.</p>

<p>When a certain number of minutes had elapsed he beckoned
to Mr. Garrabrant, who, anticipating the summons,
had been hovering nearby. Together with Elmer, the
scout master hurried up.</p>

<p>"The water is boiling all right," he announced, "and
Number Five wins. But keep going, the balance of you,
until we learn who comes in second and third."</p>

<p>Matty Eggleston proved an easy second, while Ted Burgoyne
edged in just ahead of Mark, because, as he claimed,
his "blowing apparatus worked better."</p>

<p>"But I think we ought to protest that win of Lil Artha,"
declared Chatz Maxfield, although he had been one
of the last in the bunch.</p>

<p>"On what grounds?" asked Mr. Garrabrant, smiling,
as though he had expected to hear something of the sort,
though hardly from one who had no chance of winning.</p>

<p>"When his kettle upset he didn't go all the way to the
lake to fill it again, as he ought to have done," said Red
Huggins, who had also the ill fortune to overturn his tin
vessel when the water had begun to steam, and who naturally
felt a little "sore" as he termed it, because it was
too late for him to enter again.</p>

<p>"Listen while I read the terms of the competition again,"
said Mr. Garrabrant. "I wrote them down so as to be
prepared for any event; that's one of our cardinal principles,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
you know, boys. Here it especially states that 'any
competitor who upsets his kettle at any time during the
test may have the privilege of filling the same again from
the nearest water.'"</p>

<p>"Oh! I didn't think of it that way, sir!" exclaimed
Red.</p>

<p>"That's just it," smiled the gentleman. "You failed
to grasp all there was in that rule, while Arthur analyzed
it. He undoubtedly laid his plans beforehand, in which
he proved himself a true scout, preparing for eventualities,
even though he may not have expected to meet with such
an accident. He remembered that little stream, and even
the fact that there was a small basin scooped out where
a pail could be quickly dipped in and filled. All the more
credit to Arthur for his forethought. He doubly deserves
the honor he has won, and I congratulate him on his victory.
It will be an object lesson to the rest of you. In
time of peace prepare for war. And now we will turn
our attention to another test. Perhaps some of the rest
may excel in that. I want everyone to do his very best,
and earn marks that will help to take you out of the tenderfoot
class and make second-class scouts."</p>

<p>It was now the turn of Elmer to interest his camp-mates.
He had been looking around before this, and laid his
plans, so that he was able to lead the entire bunch to a
neighboring gully, where in the soft mud alongside a
stream he had discovered several distinctly separate sets
of animal tracks.</p>

<p>Here he pointed out to them the marked difference between
the trail of a muskrat from that of a mink, and even
went so far as to tell a number of things which the latter
cautious animal had probably done in his passage down
the ravine in search of food.</p>

<p>Mr. Garrabrant listened carefully himself, and nodded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
approvingly from time to time, to show how much he liked
Elmer's way of reasoning.</p>

<p>"You can see, boys," he remarked finally, when the lesson
was over for that occasion, "what a vast amount of
mighty interesting information can be drawn from so simple
a sign as the spoor of a little slender-bodied mink.
Elmer has made a study of the animal, and knows his ways
to a dot. I think he described all that the mink did
on his way along here, just as it actually occurred. And
the deeper one dips into such woods' lore, the more fascinating
it is found. All around you are dozens of things that
strike the educated eye as deeply interesting and worthy
of study, but which would never be seen by the tenderfoot.
And it is this power of observation that we wish our boy
scouts to employ constantly. Once the fever takes hold,
a new life opens up for the lover of Nature."</p>

<p>After that they busied themselves around the camp doing
various things until lunch time. About the middle of the
afternoon three relays, of two boys each, were sent out
in as many different directions. They were not to take
paper or pencil along, but simply to try to impress various
interesting things they happened to meet with, upon
their memories, and after they had returned to camp they
would be given a chance to note these down on paper. The
one of each pair who could excel in his description as to
the number and interest of the things seen, would receive
merit marks. And later on the three victors might be
pitted against each other again.</p>

<p>While the six boys were absent, for they had a couple
of hours in which to accomplish their end, those left in
camp found plenty to do. Mark spent some time in developing
the films he had exposed thus far, having a daylight
developing bath along with him. In this way he
could find a possible chance to duplicate any pictures that,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
for some unknown cause, failed to do justice to the subject.
If he waited until they returned home to get to work,
the chances would have gone forever.</p>

<p>Everybody seemed happy but Ted Burgoyne, and he went
about with an expression of gloom on his face that of
course may have been assumed.</p>

<p>"Didn't think you took it to heart so, Ted," remarked
Elmer, as he confronted the other, while the rest of the
stay-at-homes were busily debating some question near the
camp fire.</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed the scowling one, disconsolately; "it
ain't about losing my chance in that blooming old competition,
by falling all over mythelf in the thtart! Oh! no,
that doethn't bother me one little bit, becauth you thee, I
just knew I had no chance against thuch a hustler as Lil
Artha."</p>

<p>"Then your breakfast must have disagreed with you,"
persisted Elmer, "though it's the first time I ever knew
you had a weak stomach, Ted."</p>

<p>"You're away off again, partner," grumbled Ted.
"Fact ith, to tell the honest truth now, like every good
scout ought to do, you're all too plagued healthy a bunch
to thuit me, that'th what."</p>

<p>"What's that&mdash;healthy?" remarked Elmer, and then
a faint grin began to creep over his face, as he caught
on to the meaning of the words. "Oh! I see now; your
heart's just set on doing good to others, ain't it? You
dream of binding up cuts, and putting soothing liniment
on bruises. And so far, not one of the boys has had the
kindness to fall down the rocks, cut himself with the ax, or
even get such a silly thing as a headache. It's a shame,
that's what it is, Ted!"</p>

<p>"Well, you can poke fun all you want," grumbled the
would-be surgeon, with an obstinate shake of his head,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
"but after a fellowth gone to all the trouble to lay in a
thtock of medicine, and studied up on cuts and bruises
and all thuch things till he just feels bristling all over with
valuable knowledge, it'th mean of the fellowth to take thuch
good care of their precious fingers and toes. What d'ye
suppose I'm going to do for a thubject, if this awful
drought keepth on? Why, I don't believe fourteen wild
boys ever kept together tho long before, without lots of
things happening that would be just pie for a fellow of
my build. Now&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the lamentations of poor Dr. Ted were interrupted
at this point, so Elmer never really knew just how far the
matter went, or if after all it were a joke.</p>

<p>Toby Jones had sprang to his feet, showing the utmost
excitement, and dancing around as though he had suddenly
sat upon a wasp's nest.</p>

<p>"What ails the fellow?" remarked Elmer; "he seems
to be pointing up at the top of the mountain, as if he
saw something there. Well, I declare, if that doesn't just
beat the Dutch now; and to think that it was Toby, the
boy who is wild over aviation, who first discovered it";
and meanwhile Toby had found his voice to shriek: "A
balloon! look at the balloon, would you, fellows? And she's
coming right down here into my hungry arms! Oh! glory!
such great luck!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE LOST SKY TRAVELER.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Half</span> a dozen boys started to cry out at once, as they
stared at the great bulky object that was apparently settling
down, after passing around a spur of the mountain
above.</p>

<p>"She's coming right at us, fellows!" shouted one.</p>

<p>"Ain't that a pilot hanging to the old basket?" demanded
a second.</p>

<p>"Nixy it ain't, Jasper. Go get your glasses, so you can
see better. That basket is plumb empty, and that's a fact.
The bally old balloon's deserted, boys!" Lil Artha declared,
and as he was known to have particularly trustworthy
vision, the balance of the group accepted his word
as the right thing.</p>

<p>Apparently the balloon had been steadily losing gas of
late, for the enormous bag had a collapsed look. It seemed
to have gotten into some circular current of air, once
beyond the mountain, for it kept moving around in spirals,
all the time dropping slowly but positively. So that unless
a new breeze caught it, the chance seemed to be that
it would actually alight on the shore of the lake, close to
the camp.</p>

<p>"Get ready to man the boats if it falls in the lake,
boys!" called Mr. Garrabrant, who recognized the fact
that such a balloon must be worth considerable to his little
troop in the way of salvage, and was determined to do what
he could to save it from sinking out of sight.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>But in the end it managed to drop on the pebbly beach.
The very first to touch the collapsed gas bag was the exuberant
Toby Jones, wild with delight over this remarkable
happening that had come to him.</p>

<p>"I claim it by right of discovery, and the first to lay
a hand on the balloon!" he shouted, as he fondly ran his
fingers along the strong material of which the air vessel
was constructed.</p>

<p>"Where on earth could it have come from?" more than
one of the boys asked, as they surveyed the immense girth
of silken cloth with wondering eyes.</p>

<p>"There's a circus over at Warrendale," announced Ted.
"Perhaps she broke away from there in a wind storm, or
else bucked the aviators out. Whew! think of tumbling
down hundreds of feet! Guess I couldn't 'a' been of much
use around there, if that's what happened to the air navigators;
the more the pity," and Ted actually looked discontented,
as though another golden opportunity had
slipped past him.</p>

<p>"Sounds like a good guess, Ted," remarked Elmer;
"but there happen to be several things to knock it silly."</p>

<p>"As what?" demanded the boy with the long legs, who
always wanted to be shown.</p>

<p>"For instance, you know where Warrendale lies, off to
the east from here," the scout leader explained, in the
most accommodating way possible, "while this thing must
have come from the west! You saw it sail over the mountain
up there, and we've been having constant west winds
for several days now. Isn't that so, Mr. Garrabrant?"</p>

<p>"Every word of it, Elmer," replied the gentleman, who
was never happier than when listening to this wide-awake
scout substantiating his claim.</p>

<p>"And besides, here's a name sewed to the balloon&mdash;<i>Republic!</i>
Seems to me, sir, I've seen that name before. Unless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
I'm away off it was one of the big gas bags entered
for that long-distance endurance race, which was to come
off away out in St. Louis, or somewhere along the Mississippi
River."</p>

<p>"Oh! my, just to think of it, fellows!" gasped Toby,
his face fairly aglow with overwhelming delight, while he
continued to fondle the material of which the collapsible
balloon was constructed, as though he might be almost
worshiping the same.</p>

<p>"Why, that's hundreds and hundreds of miles away!"
declared another incredulous one.</p>

<p>"Don't seem possible, does it, that a balloon could sail
that far?" a third had the temerity to remark, when Toby
turned upon him instantly, saying:</p>

<p>"Say, you don't read the papers, do you? If you did
you'd know that in a drifting race a balloon went all the
way without touching ground from St. Louis up into New
England, while another passed over into Canada away up
above Quebec, and won the race. Others fell near Baltimore,
and such places. There can't be any doubt about it,
boys, this wanderer has drifted all the way from the old
Mississippi. But whatever could have become of her
crew?"</p>

<p>The thought saddened them for the time being, but it
was difficult for Toby to subdue the excitement under which
he was laboring.</p>

<p>"Oh! if I only knew how to manufacture gas so as to
fill her up again, mebbe I wouldn't like to take a spin,
and surprise the Hickory Ridge people, though! Think
how my dad's eyes would bulge out, fellows, when I landed
right in his dooryard, and asked how ma was? Ted, you
know lots of things&mdash;can't you tell me how to make hot
air?"</p>

<p>Ted did not answer, only grinned and looked toward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Lil Artha so very suggestively that the rest burst out into
a howl, for the long-legged boy was known to be something
of an orator, who could speak for half an hour if warmed
up to his subject.</p>

<p>"None for sale!" remarked that individual, promptly,
whereat Toby pretended to be grievously disappointed, for
he gave the tall boy a look of scorn, saying:</p>

<p>"There he goes again, fellows; declining to make a
martyr of himself for the sake of science. Why, I even
heard Dr. Ted offering to sew on his finger again so neat
that no one could tell where it had been separated, and
would you believe it, Lil Artha was mean enough to abjectly
decline? But I'm going to think over it, and if I can
only fill this big bag with gas I'll leave camp on a little
foraging expedition, to bring back more grub. For Ginger
is eating us out of house and home, ain't he, Mr.
Garrabrant?"</p>

<p>So they laughed and joked as they continued to gather
around the balloon that had seemingly dropped from the
skies. Elmer alone was thoughtful. He could not but
wonder what the story connected with the <i>Republic</i> might
be. Had the brave pilot and his assistant been thrown out
in some storm which they were endeavoring to ride out?
If that proved true, then the history of the fallen balloon
must be a tragic one.</p>

<p>Under the direction of the scout master they dragged the
tremendous bag, now emptied of its gaseous contents, and
piled it up close to the camp. When the time came for
the return trip possibly they might find some means for
transporting the balloon to the home town, and when the
fact of its discovery was published in the great New York
dailies, the name of Hickory Ridge would become famous.</p>

<p>This new event afforded plenty of topics for conversation.
As usual the boys argued the matter pro and con. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
even took sides, and debated with considerable heat the
various phases of the happening.</p>

<p>Some of them got out paper and pencil to figure just
how many hours it might take a balloon to come all the
way from St. Louis for instance, granting that a westerly
breeze prevailed. All sorts of ideas prevailed as to the
number of miles an hour the wind had blown, ranging from
five to fifty.</p>

<p>In the end, after all theories had been ventilated, the
boys were no nearer a solution of the mystery than before,
only it seemed now to be the consensus of opinion that the
<i>Republic</i> must have been entered in some race, and possibly
away out on the bank of the mighty river that divides
our republic almost in half.</p>

<p>"About time some of our strollers turned up, I should
think," remarked Mr. Garrabrant, as he and Elmer sat
in front of the tents, listening to the jabbering of the
disputants, though all the argument was carried on in good
temper.</p>

<p>"Speak of an angel, and you hear its wings," laughed
the scout leader, as a shrill halloo came from the woods
close by.</p>

<p>Two of the boys who had gone forth to observe such
things as they came across, presently appeared in camp.
They looked tired and hungry, and began to sniff the appetizing
odors that were beginning to permeate the camp,
for several messes of beans were cooking, and Ginger was
employed in preparing a heap of big onions for a grand
fry that would just about fill the bill, most of the boys
thought.</p>

<p>But while the incidents accompanying their long walk
and climb were still fresh in their memories they were made
to sit down alone, and write a list of those things they could
recall, and which had impressed them most of all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently two more weary pilgrims came in sight, limping
along, and only too glad to get back safe and sound.
Ted kept an eager watch and tally as they made their appearance.
His face was seen to drop several degrees when,
in answer to the solicitous inquiries of the scout master,
they reported no accidents, and all sound.</p>

<p>"There goeth another golden opportunity!" Ted exclaimed,
shaking his head in real or assumed disgust. "I
never thaw thuch ungrateful fellers in all my life. Why,
it begins to look like <i>nobody</i> would even get a finger
thcratched. I expect after all I'll just have to get Tom
Cropthey to let me pull that tooth of hith that aches
like thixty. I hate to come down to it, but thomething's
got to be done to thave the country!"</p>

<p>"It don't hurt now, I tell you," remonstrated Tom.
"You needn't go to coaxin' me any more, because I tell
you right off that I ain't meanin' to have it out when
it acts decent like. Wait till she gets me goin' again, anyhow.
And that's straight off the reel, take it or leave it."</p>

<p>The second couple were likewise settled off, each fellow
by himself, and the balance of the troop ordered not to
disturb the train of their thoughts until both had jotted
down the smallest item that they had noticed. In the end
the papers would be read aloud, and many interesting
things be disclosed, showing what a fund of knowledge
there lies all around one at any time, if only he chooses to
take notice of the same.</p>

<p>"That leaves only Red and Larry to be heard from,"
remarked Mr. Garrabrant, who believed he had great reason
to congratulate himself, as well as his boys, on the fact
that thus far so little had happened to cause trouble, no
matter how much the ambitious, and only too willing, doctor-surgeon
might bewail his hard luck.</p>

<p>"They ought to be coming soon, sir, because it won't be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
long before dusk now. And I don't think either of those
boys would care to be lost up here after nightfall," Elmer
observed, listening as though he fancied he had caught some
suggestive sound up the steep slope, that might betray the
coming of the last pair.</p>

<p>"I wonder did any of the others happen to see them?"
said the scout master. "Here comes the first couple, having
finished their task. This way, boys, please; I want
to ask if either of you in the course of your wanderings
happened to run across Oscar Huggins and Larry Billings?
They are the only missing scouts, and as the hour is growing
late, I would like to get a point as to where they may
be."</p>

<p>Neither of the returned ones, however, could give him
the least information, nor was he able to succeed any better
when he asked the other couple. Apparently the absent
pair must have taken a course entirely different from any
of their comrades.</p>

<p>The twilight now began to gather under the shelter of
the high mountain, and Mr. Garrabrant looked a bit worried.
If the boys had been unfortunate enough as to lose
themselves, he knew that they had taken plenty of matches
along, and moreover they had been instructed in various
devices whereby they might communicate with their comrades,
by waving a burning torch, for instance, from some
high elevation, certain movements standing for letters in
the Morse code, as used by the Signal Corps of the army.</p>

<p>"I think I hear voices up yonder, sir," remarked Elmer,
coming up behind the scout master, who was watching the
finishing preparations for supper that were going on at the
several fires.</p>

<p>"Yes, I thought so myself, and what you say, Elmer,
makes me more positive," Mr. Garrabrant observed, a smile
taking the place of the grave look on his handsome face.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
"Yes, there they come yonder, looking as tired as the others.
And it may be that I deceive myself, but it strikes me both
lads seem to be greatly excited over something or other.
I sincerely hope nothing has happened to injure them. I
notice no limp in their gait, and each seems to have the
full use of both arms. What can have happened to them
now?"</p>

<p>"At any rate we'll soon know, sir, for here they are,"
said Elmer, encouragingly, as Red and Larry limped up to
the camp, and with sundry grunts sank upon a log as if to
signify how utterly exhausted they might be.</p>

<p>"But tired or not, sir, we're just ready to go out again
with you, after we've had some supper," declared Red,
to the utter wonderment of the clustering scouts.</p>

<p>"Then I was right in my surmise, and you <i>have</i> run
across something out of the common, boys?" remarked Mr.
Garrabrant.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Red promptly replied, "we certainly have;
and many times we felt mad to think we came away to get
help instead of staying there, and trying ourselves to investigate,
so as to find out what the groans meant we heard
coming from that lonely hut!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A BLAZED TRAIL.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a chorus of exclamations from the gathered
scouts, when they heard Red express himself in this startling
way. Eyes grew round with wonder, and more than one
lad almost held his breath, as he waited to catch further
particulars of the strange happening that had befallen their
two chums during their tramp.</p>

<p>"Where was this at, Oscar?" asked the scout master,
quickly, alive to the importance of ascertaining all there
was to be made known.</p>

<p>"I think it must have been all of a mile and a half from
here, sir," returned Red, who seldom heard his real name
mentioned save in school or at home.</p>

<p>"And the way is mighty rough, too, sir," Larry put in,
rubbing his chin as if it might pain him somewhat, which
action caused Ted to grin, and nod his head.</p>

<p>"Thee you later, Larry," he muttered. "I bet you
now, I don't let thith chance get away from me. That
boy'th badly hurt, and just won't acknowledge it, but
wait till Dr. Ted geth hold of him, that'th what."</p>

<p>"Do you think you can lead us back there, in case we
make up our minds to go to-night after supper?" Mr. Garrabrant
continued.</p>

<p>"Easy, sir," came the answer, in confident tones. "You
see, we made it a point to mark the trail as we came along,
by cutting the trunks of trees, and breaking branches so
as to catch the eye. Elmer was telling us lately how he did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
once when lost in the timber in Canada, the 'bush' he
called it, and we remembered."</p>

<p>"That's just fine, Oscar," commented the scout master,
as though pleased at so great a show of forethought in two
of his charges. "It shows what this business is already
doing for all of you&mdash;teaching you to use your heads at
any and all times. That was well done, and I imagine we'll
have little or no difficulty in tracing your progress back,
even if you are too tired to accompany us, for we will have
Elmer along."</p>

<p>"Oh! but I'm bound to go, if I have to drag my game
leg behind me," asserted Red. "You see, both of us feel
sore over coming away without trying longer to find out
what it was groaning so in that cabin, and we want to make
good."</p>

<p>"Does it hurt you <i>very</i> much, Red?" asked the solicitous
Ted, coming up with a face that seemed marked with
feeling.</p>

<p>"Sure it does, Ted," replied the other, promptly, "and
I'm going to ask you to rub some liniment on right away.
Reckon I just sprained it a little, slipping down the side
of the mountain."</p>

<p>"Good for you, Red!" ejaculated the pleased amateur
surgeon, as he clasped the other by the arm. "Come right
along with me, and I'll fix you up in a jiffy. Only too
glad to be of thervice. And Red, you're the only gentleman&mdash;"
he suddenly paused, gave one smiling look around
at the frowning faces of his mates, and then completed his
sentence: "who hath applied to me for treatment. I'll
never forget this kindneth, never!"</p>

<p>"Hold on!" remarked the scout master. "We must
know a little more about this matter before you drag your
patient away; though of course we expect him to survive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
the treatment. Tell us about the lone cabin, Oscar. How
did you happen on it?"</p>

<p>"We had turned," Red started to say, "and were heading
toward home, when all of a sudden I thought I heard
a plain human groan. Larry said he had caught some sort
of sound, too. So we began to advance in that direction,
going slow-like, because you see we didn't know what sort
of trickery we might be up against. Then we caught sight
of a cabin that was half hidden among the trees and
bushes."</p>

<p>"Ugh!" Larry broke in with, "it just gave us both
the creeps, sir, to see how awful lonely the old place looked,
run down and neglected like. If Chatz had been along, he'd
sure have believed his pet ghost lived there."</p>

<p>"But surely two sensible chaps like you and Oscar
wouldn't think of such a thing as that?" remarked Mr.
Garrabrant.</p>

<p>"Oh! no, sir," replied Red, after shooting a swift look
toward his comrade in misery. "But you see, the groans
kept on acomin' out of that window, and we could hear
voices too. We didn't hardly now what to do, go on and
knock at the door, or hurry back here to report. Larry,
he gave me a cold chill, I admit sir, when he just accidentally
said that it might be a ease of smallpox in that hut&mdash;
you know there were some cases this last spring to the north
of the Ridge."</p>

<p>"And after talking it over, you decided that the wisest
thing to be done was to make your way to camp, and throw
the responsibility on my shoulders?" said the scout master.
"Well, perhaps it was far better you did this than take
chances. I have no doubt but what you might have adopted
a different course if you had not had help near by."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, that's just what I said to Larry&mdash;that you'd
know best what ought to be done; but that if we were all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
alone in the region, we'd just have to go up to the door and
knock."</p>

<p>"And so you set out to reach camp as fast as you
could?" continued Mr. Garrabrant.</p>

<p>"That's what we did sir, and in such a hurry that several
times we slipped and barked our shins, while I got a
jar when I tumbled."</p>

<p>"Oh! I'll fix that all right, in three thhakes of a lam'th
tail, if you'll only come over to my tent," said Ted, tugging
at the arm of each returned wanderer.</p>

<p>And unable to resist his urgent plea, they allowed him
to lead them away. Later on when they once more appeared,
as supper was announced by the assembly call, the
pair of wounded scouts admitted that Dr. Ted had indeed
done wonders, inasmuch that their pains had miraculously
vanished, and they felt able to undertake the rough journey
again&mdash;after they had broken their fast.</p>

<p>There was much speculation during the meal as to whom
Mr. Garrabrant would select to accompany him on his trip.
Of course Elmer was a foregone conclusion, as his natural
ability along the line of following a blazed trail might come
in pat.</p>

<p>But the scout master settled all doubts by announcing
toward the close of the meal that he wished Red, Elmer,
Arthur, Dr. Ted (in case his services were needed), Jack
Armitage and Ty Collins to accompany him.</p>

<p>No one murmured, for they knew it would do no good.
Larry started to ask why he had been left out; but Mr.
Garrabrant had noted his pallor, and understood that he
did not possess the sturdy physique his comrade of the
tramp boasted, and on that account had better remain in
camp.</p>

<p>Another thing some of the observing lads noticed, and
this was the fact that as a rule those selected, outside of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Dr. Ted, were the strongest in the troop. Perhaps, then,
Mr. Garrabrant might anticipate trouble of some sort, and
wished to have a healthy band of scouts at his back, especially
since none of them carried arms of any kind&mdash;though
the scout master really did have a revolver secreted
in his bag, which, unseen by any of the boys, he now made
sure to hide on his person.</p>

<p>There could be no telling what they might find themselves
up against. Rumor had it that certain hard characters
at one time made their headquarters somewhere up in
the woods around the lakes, and who could say that the
lone cabin might not prove to be a nest of yeggmen or
hoboes?</p>

<p>"How does your thprain feel; think you can thtand it?"
asked Ted of Red, as they got up from around the fire and
prepared to sally forth on their mission of mercy.</p>

<p>"If you hadn't reminded me of it just then, I'd sure
never have thought I had a game leg," remarked the other.
"You're all to the good when it comes to doctoring a fellow,
Ted; if only you wouldn't talk so much about sawing
off legs and all such awful things."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be along in ease you feel it again, and I'll
make thure to carry a tin of that magic liniment," remarked
the ambitious surgeon, as he reentered the tent, to
make up a little package of things he thought might come
in handy in case they found some one sick in the hut.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, acting on the suggestion of Elmer, the other
boys selected such stout canes and cudgels as lay around
camp.</p>

<p>"Be prepared!" grinned Lil Artha, as he swung a particularly
dangerous looking club around his head until it
fairly whistled through the air. "That's the motto of the
Boy Scouts, and I reckon it applies in a case of this kind,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
just as much as when stopping a runaway horse. I'm prepared
to give a good account of myself, that's dead certain."</p>

<p>Mr. Garrabrant had fetched out a couple of lanterns,
making sure that the oil receptacles were well filled, so that
they would last through the journey, going and returning.</p>

<p>"Now we're off, boys," he remarked, with a pleasant
smile. "The rest of you stay here and look close after the
camp. I've appointed Mark Cummings to serve in my place
while I'm gone, and shall expect every scout to pay him
just as much respect as though I were present. Lead off,
Oscar, we're with you."</p>

<p>Red took up his place at the head of the little bunch. He
carried one of the lanterns with which he cast sufficient
light ahead to see where he was going.</p>

<p>"First to take you to the seven sentry chestnuts," he
said. "We named 'em that, of course, when we came on
'em. The blazed trail commences right there, sir. We
didn't think it worth while to do any more slicing of bark
after that, because we knew we could easy enough find our
way back to that place."</p>

<p>And he did lead the party to the seven chestnuts, with
only one or two periods of hesitation, during which he had
to puzzle things out.</p>

<p>"There's the first blaze on that oak yonder," he remarked,
pointing as he spoke. "We tried to make the
marks close enough so as to show by lantern light, because
we both had an idea you'd want to come on before morning,
sir."</p>

<p>Elmer was at the side of the leader by this time, prepared
to lend his experience in case the other ran up against a
snag. He took especial note of the general direction in
which the numerous blazes seemed to run. And when <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'presenty'">presently</ins>
Red confessed that he was "stumped" if he could
see where the next mark ought to be, Elmer had them hold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
up while he walked forward in the quarter where, on general
principles, he imagined the blaze should be. And in
another minute his soft "cooee" told his comrades that
he had, sure enough, found the missing mark.</p>

<p>Many times did Red have to fall back on Elmer to help
him out. His blazes had apparently been further apart than
he had realized at the time he made them. But the boy who
had lived in Canada, and experienced all sorts of frontier
life, knew just how to go about making the needed discovery;
and in every instance success rewarded his efforts.</p>

<p>"We're getting close to the place now," Red finally announced,
as he limped along, refusing to allow Ted the
privilege of rubbing his strained leg again, because he did
not want to waste the time.</p>

<p>"Then you recognize some of the landmarks?" suggested
Mr. Garrabrant.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I do that," came the confident reply. "In
another five minutes I think we'll be able to see something
of that queer cabin that is half hidden in the dense undergrowth."</p>

<p>"Perhaps less than five minutes," remarked Elmer,
quietly. "Look yonder, sir, and you'll just catch a
glimpse of what seems to be a tiny speck of light. I think
that must spring from the window of the hut Red
speaks of."</p>

<p>"You are right again, Elmer, as always," replied the
scout master, drawing in a long breath. "Now, forward,
slowly, boys. Let no one stumble, if it can possibly be
avoided; for we do not know what we may be up against.
But if there is anyone suffering in that cabin, it is our duty
to investigate, no matter what the danger. Elmer, lead the
way with me, please."</p>

<p>Cautiously they crept forward, foot by foot. Doubtless
many a heart beat faster than ordinary, because there was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
a certain air of mystery hovering over the whole affair, and
they could imagine a dozen separate strange sights that
might meet their vision once they peeped into the little
window of that isolated cabin.</p>

<p>But no one would ever confess that such a thing as fear
tugged at the strings of his heart. Already the discipline
they had been under since joining the scout movement was
bearing fruit; timidity was put aside with a stern hand, and
keeping in a bunch they advanced until presently those in
the lead were able to rise up from hands and knees, glueing
their eager eyes upon the little opening through which came
the light that had guided them to the spot.</p>

<p>And right then and there they heard a groan, so full of
suffering and misery that it went straight to the heart of
every boy who had been drafted by the scout master to accompany
him on this strange night errand.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>WHAT THE LONE CABIN CONTAINED.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Elmer Chenowith looked through that opening,
what he saw was so entirely different from what he had
anticipated discovering that he could hardly believe his
eyes at first.</p>

<p>With all the fancy of a boy, who gives free rein to his
imagination, doubtless he had fully expected to discover
several gruff-looking hoboes gathered there, perhaps engaged
in torturing one of their kind, or some wretched party
who had fallen into their power.</p>

<p>Nothing of the sort. The very first object Elmer saw was
a small boy, dressed in ragged clothes, and who was trying
to blow a dying fire into life again.</p>

<p>This did not look very alarming; and so Elmer cast his
eyes further afield, with the result that presently another
moving object riveted his attention. Why, surely that must
be a girl, for her long hair seemed to indicate as much!
What was she bending over? Was that a rude cot?</p>

<p>Then the strange truth burst upon Elmer like a cannon
shot. The groans&mdash;they must indicate that a sick person
lay there, and these two small children (for the boy could
not be over six, while the girl might be eight) were trying
to carry out the combined duties of nurse, doctor and cook!</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>It was Red himself who gave utterance to this low exclamation.
He was peering in at the opening over the
shoulder of Mr. Garrabrant, and what he saw was so vastly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
different from his expectations that he received a severe
"jolt," as he himself afterwards expressed it.</p>

<p>Perhaps the sound, low as it was, reached the ears of the
little girl guardian of the sick bed. They saw her give a
jump, and immediately a pair of startled blue eyes were
staring in the direction of the opening.</p>

<p>"Come!" said Mr. Garrabrant to his boys, "there is no
need of any more secrecy. I think we are needed here, and
badly, too."</p>

<p>He led the way around the corner of the lone lodge, with
the scouts tagging at his heels, only too willing to follow.
Reaching the door of the cabin they were about to enter,
when Mr. Garrabrant uttered an exclamation of alarm.</p>

<p>"Get on to the girl, would you?" gasped Lil Artha; and
there was no need of his attempting to explain, since his
chums could see for themselves.</p>

<p>Small though she was, the girl had snatched up a long-barreled
gun, and was now actually menacing the intruders.
Her white face had a desperate look upon it, as though at
some time in the past the child had been warned that there
were bad men to be met with in those woods. As for the
little chap, he had hold of the hatchet with which at the
time he must have been cutting kindling wood; for he
clutched it in his puny hand, and looked like a dwarfed
wildcat at bay.</p>

<p>Elmer, as long as he lived, would never forget that
picture. And as for the other boys, not one of them could
so much as utter a single word.</p>

<p>"Hold on, my child!" cried Mr. Garrabrant, raising his
hands to show that they did not hold any sort of weapon;
"we are friends, and would be only too glad to be of help
to you. One of us is something of a doctor, if it happens
that anyone is sick here. Please let us come in."</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the kindly look of the handsome young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
scout master&mdash;then again his voice may have influenced the
frightened girl; or the fact that those in the open doorway
were mostly boys might have had considerable to do with it.
Then again that magical word "doctor" must have thrilled
her through and through.</p>

<p>The gun fell to the floor, and the relieved girl burst into
a flood of tears.</p>

<p>"It's dad!" she cried, moving a hand toward the rude
cot behind her; and as the eyes of the boys flitted thither
again, they saw a bearded and very sick looking man trying
to raise himself up on his elbow.</p>

<p>Mr. Garrabrant immediately went toward him, uttering
reassuring words, that no doubt did much to relieve the
alarm of the occupant of the rude bed. Wisely had the
long-headed scout master caused one of the boys to carry
some food along, not knowing what necessity might arise.
He saw that hunger was holding sway in this lone cabin
as well as sickness. And while Red started the fire to going,
Ty Collins proceeded to unwrap the package of meat and
bread, as well as the coffee and tea he had "toted" all the
way from camp.</p>

<p>Mr. Garrabrant with a few questions learned the simple
story. The man was a charcoal burner in the summer season,
while he pursued the arduous labor of a lumberman
in the winter. A few months before his wife had suddenly
died, leaving him with these two small but very independent
children.</p>

<p>Abe Morris, his name was, while the boy carried that of
Felix; and whenever the cabin dweller spoke of the girl
it was always as "Little Lou." He had hated to leave the
retired home where he had spent so many pleasant years,
and near which his wife was buried. And so he had managed
to get along, with the girl cooking his meals and playing
the part of housekeeper wonderfully well; while even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Felix could do his stunt of gathering firewood and looking
after a few simple traps in which he caught muskrats.</p>

<p>When the boys heard that this small edition of a lad had
been able to actually outwit the shrewd animals of the
marsh, they looked at each other in dismay, as though wondering
whether he might not have a better right to the title
of scout that any among them.</p>

<p>Things had gone fairly well with the widower until a
week back, when an accident had brought him almost to
death's door. Managing to drag himself home, he had
swooned from loss of blood. Since that time he had suffered
tortures, more of the mind than of the body, since he
dreaded the thought of what would become of his children
should death claim him.</p>

<p>They had done wonderfully well. When Dr. Ted got
busy, he praised the simple but clever work of that eight-year-old
girl, in binding up such a severe wound. Perhaps
Little Lou may have learned how to do this from the mother
who was gone, or it might be it came just natural to her.
When children live away from the world, and are forced
to depend upon themselves for everything, it is amazing how
they can do things that would puzzle those twice their age,
when pampered in comfortable homes. Necessity forces
them to reach out and attempt things, just as she teaches
the child to use its limbs, and utter sounds.</p>

<p>Once they realized that these were kind friends who had
come so opportunely to their rescue, Felix and Little Lou
found their voices, and proved that they could talk, as Lil
Artha put it, "a blue streak."</p>

<p>And when they sat down to a supper such as they had
not tasted for many a day, both of the children of the charcoal
burner were comparatively happy. As for the man
himself, he wrung the hands of Mr. Garrabrant and each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
of the Boy Scouts as they took their leave, calling down
blessings on their heads for what they had done.</p>

<p>"We're going to see you through, Abe," the scout master
had said positively. "We intend being up here ten
days or so, and during that time I fully expect our Dr. Ted
will be able to have you hobbling around again. Then
you've got to come down to Hickory Ridge when we send
a vehicle of some sort up here for you. This is no place for
a man to think of bringing up two such fine youngsters as
you possess. They must have a chance to go to school, and
I promise you all the work you want, so that you can live
in or near town. It may have been different so long as
your good wife was with you, but now it would be next
door to a crime to think of staying here, even for the balance
of the summer. You will come, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Sure I will, Mr. Garrabrant!" exclaimed the rough
man; who, however, used better language than might have
been expected. "And it's the luckiest day of my whole life
when those two lads discovered my shack here. Heaven only
knows what would have become of us only for that."</p>

<p>They left the queer home in the wilderness with Felix and
Little Lou waving their hands vigorously after them, standing
in the doorway, and plainly seen against the firelight
behind.</p>

<p>And there was not one among those boys but who felt a
warm sensation in the region of his heart, such as always
comes when a kind deed has been performed.</p>

<p>Mr. Garrabrant had been greatly affected by the incident;
nor did he hesitate to express himself warmly on the journey
back to the camp, which by the way Elmer managed
to accomplish without even one error of judgment, much to
the admiration of his chums, who watched his actions
eagerly, desirous of picking up points calculated to enhance
their reputation as scouts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"Boys, you may have made other tramps, going skating,
hunting, playing baseball, and the like; but take my word
for it, you never acquitted yourselves better than on this
night. I'm proud of every one of you, and I thank you in
the name of poor Abe Morris. And if there happens to be
anyone here who has been wearing his badge upside down
through the day, because he failed to find a chance to do
anybody a good turn, I hereby give him full permission to
set it right."</p>

<p>"Hurrah! that touches me, sir!" exclaimed Jack Armitage.
"I've been wondering all along just how in the wide
world I was going to find a chance to do my little kind deed
stunt. There ain't any old ladies to help across the street
up here; and dooryards to clear up of trash are as scarce as
hens' teeth. But you've eased my mind a heap, Mr. Garrabrant.
Perhaps you'll let me do some of the running over
to Abe's cabin each day, to carry him supplies. That sturdy
little chap just took my eye, and when I get back home I'm
going to get father to give Abe a job in his flooring mill."</p>

<p>"That's nice of you, Jack," replied the pleased scout
master. "And it does your heart credit. Between us all,
it will be very strange if we can't fix up that little family,
and bring some happiness to their bleak home. Think of
those two brave kiddies keeping house for their father amid
such desolate surroundings. No wonder they made me think
of a pair of wildcats ready to defend their den as we bustled
in. They seldom see a living soul but their father, now that
the mother has been laid away. But we must be nearly back
at camp, I should judge, Elmer? At any rate, I admit that
I'm beginning to feel leg weary, not being used to this work
of tramping over the side of a rough mountain."</p>

<p>"But just think of Red, here, thir," broke in Dr. Ted,
who had a helping arm around the lame member of the expedition.
"He thure detherves a medal for what he's done.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Tramping all thith distance with that thore ankle ith&mdash;well,
I wath going to thay heroic, but I guess he wouldn't
like that. Anyhow, I think pretty much all the credit ought
to go to Red."</p>

<p>"Now, just you hold your horses there!" declared the
party in question, trying to repress a groan, as he had a
rude twinge of pain shoot up his left leg. "I owe all this
to myself, and more, because I made the mistake of running
off without finding out what that groan meant. I've wanted
to kick myself ever since. It ain't often I play the part of
a sneak, and it makes me sore. So whenever my leg hurts
I just grin and say to myself: 'Serves you right, you coward,
for running away, instead of investigating, like a true
scout should have done!'"</p>

<p>"You are too severe on yourself, Oscar," remarked Mr.
Garrabrant, soothingly; for he knew the impulsive and
warm-hearted nature of the boy who was taking himself so
much to task. "When your companion suggested that perhaps
there was a case of smallpox in that hut, it was your
duty to come to me and report, rather than take the awful
responsibility on your young shoulders. And I mean to see
to it that you get many good marks for what you have done
this night&mdash;not you alone, but every boy who accompanied
me on this errand of mercy."</p>

<p>"There's the camp fire, sir!" exclaimed Elmer, at this
moment.</p>

<p>"I bet you Redth glad to see it, poor old chap!" remarked
Dr. Ted.</p>

<p>"Shucks! I reckon I could have stood it a little while
longer!" declared the limping one; but when he presently
reached the home camp, and sank down on a blanket, the
pain he had been silently enduring all the return trip was
too much for him, and Red actually fainted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course he was quickly brought to, and Dr. Ted looked
to the injured limb.</p>

<p>"You'll have to lie around pretty much all the balance
of the time we're run up in thith neck of the woodth, old fellow,"
was his announcement; which dictum made Red do
what the pain had failed to accomplish, groan dismally.</p>

<p>Of course those who had been left behind were fairly
clamorous to know what had happened. So sitting there by
the crackling fire, with all those bright and eager faces surrounding
him, the scout master, assisted at times by Elmer,
Ted or Lil Artha, described their long jaunt over the grim
mountainside, the finding of the lone cabin, just as Red and
Larry had said, and what wonderful discovery they had
made upon peering in through the open window.</p>

<p>And every boy felt that a golden opportunity had come
to their organization that night to live up to the high ideals
the Boy Scout movement stands for.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>WIGWAGGING FROM THE MOUNTAIN PEAK.</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Another</span> fine day for a few more tests, and such things,
fellows!" sang out Chatz Maxfield, on the following morning,
after they had finished breakfast.</p>

<p>The night had actually passed without any sign of alarm.
Although Chatz had fully anticipated a return of his stalking
ghost, while he stood out his turn as a sentry, he had met
with disappointment, for nothing happened. Still, he did
not wholly give up hope of meeting up with the "misty
white object" again. The jeers of his mates had begun to
take effect, and Chatz really wanted to have the thing settled,
one way or the other, as soon as possible. Either there
were such things as ghosts, or there were not. And he
wished to be convinced, declaring that he was open to conviction,
if only they could prove to the contrary.</p>

<p>"Yes," remarked Mark Cummings, who was near by,
with others of the scouts; "and I guess Mr. Garrabrant has
laid out a bully and strenuous old day for the lot of us,
barring Red and Ginger, who are to keep camp. He speaks
of sending one bunch to the top of Mount Pisgah, as this
peak is called, while another tries to climb Mount Horab
yonder. They ought to get up there about noon, and for
two hours wigwag to each other, sending and receiving messages
that are to be kept in books provided for the purpose.
Then, at night, when we all meet again around the camp
fire, we'll have heaps of fun, seeing just how stupid we've
been in our Signal Corps work."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't you forget, Mark," said Red, who was lounging
on a log close by, "that you promised to let me try a few
prints from those negatives you developed and fixed. I'm
a pretty good hand at that work, so they tell me at home,
and I'd like to see how we all look up here in camp."</p>

<p>"All right, Red," replied Mark, cheerfully. "You shall
do the job, and welcome. I've seen some of your work, and
it's sure the best ever. I'll fix up a place in the tent here,
where you can hobble if you want to, after you've done your
printing and want to fix the pictures."</p>

<p>"But you want to go easy on that leg, remember,"
warned Dr. Ted, shaking a finger at his patient, just as he
had seen the old family doctor do many a time.</p>

<p>"You and Jack are bound over the side of the mountain
to visit the Abe Morris family, I heard?" remarked Chatz,
speaking to Ted.</p>

<p>"Yeth, it is a professional visit on my part," replied the
other, pretending to look very dignified. "But Mr. Garrabrant
hath promithed that everyone of you shall have a
turn to accompany me day by day, tho ath to make the acquaintance
of those two brave kiddies, as he calls them,
Felix and Little Lou."</p>

<p>"I'm right glad to hear that, suh," remarked Chatz;
"from what you all tell me, I'm quite anxious to meet
up with that boy and girl. And if Jack falls through with
his plan of getting Abe employment in his father's mill, I
think I know just where he would fit into a good position."</p>

<p>The two companies left camp about eight o'clock. Dr.
Ted and Jack Armitage waved them good-by, for they too
were getting ready to start on their errand to the lone cabin
in the woods.</p>

<p>Elmer headed one group of scouts, while Mr. Garrabrant
had charge of the other. They carried plenty of lunch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
along, though it was expected that they would surely be
back before evening had set in.</p>

<p>The scout master was not at all positive about his thorough
knowledge of woodcraft; for as yet it was almost
wholly theoretical rather than practical with him.</p>

<p>"I am not above getting lost, in spite of my book knowledge,"
he had laughed, as he selected what boys were to
accompany him; "and that is why I take Matty Eggleston,
Mark Cummings, and Arthur Stansbury among my followers;
because next to Elmer, they are known to possess practical
ideas concerning this traveling in unknown timber. So
good-by, lads; we'll look to have a good talk with you across
the valley."</p>

<p>So day after day he expected to put the scouts "through
their paces," as Lil Artha called it. To-day it was to be
the great hike to the tops of the mountains, and the wigwagging
contest between the two factions. To-morrow he
meant to have Elmer give further lessons along the line of
following a trail, showing just how an experienced woodsman
can tell from many sources how long ago the party had
passed; the number of which it consisted; whether they were
men, women or children; white or Indians; and even describing
some of the marked peculiarities of the members
comprising it.</p>

<p>Then later on they would have swimming contests; first
aid to the injured lessons; resuscitating a person who has
come near being drowned; cooking rivalry; athletics; and
many other things connected with the open life.</p>

<p>It proved a long and arduous tramp for Elmer and his
companions. He had had the privilege of choosing which
mountain he would attempt to scale, and just like an ambitious
boy, had selected the one he felt sure would be the
more difficult.</p>

<p>Those who followed his lead had many times to beg of him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
to halt and take a little breathing spell, for the way was
very rough and much climbing of rocks had to be done in
order to mount upward.</p>

<p>"Wow! are we ever going to get up there?" grunted
Toby, who had just hated to come on this expedition at all,
when he would much rather have liked hanging around
camp, and examining the deflated balloon; no doubt dreaming
dreams of the time when he hoped to have the chance
to soar away among the clouds in one of those gas bags.</p>

<p>"Seems like that mountain top is just nigh as far away
from us as ever," complained Larry Billings, who was
puffing at a great rate, as he seemed to be rather short
winded, and had to be taken to task several times for his
faulty manner of walking.</p>

<p>"Oh! no, you're greatly mistaken there," laughed Elmer.
"Distances are deceptive in the mountains, to anyone not
used to measuring them with the eye. Just wait a little,
and all at once you're going to realize that we're getting up
handsomely. Look across the valley, and see how high we
are right now! That proves it, Larry."</p>

<p>"Hey! what's that moving, away up on that other hill,
Elmer?" cried Jasper Merriweather, the novice and real
tenderfoot of the crowd; who, under the careful supervision
of the scout leader of the Wolf Patrol, was actually
doing himself proud, and gaining new confidence in his
abilities with each passing hour.</p>

<p>Elmer followed the line of his outstretched finger.</p>

<p>"You deserve considerable praise, Jasper, for making
that discovery," he declared, presently. "I can see what
you mean now; though when I looked across before I didn't
happen to notice. Yes, that's our other squad, climbing up
just like we are, and not making any better job of it either,
I think."</p>

<p>"Ho! they ain't near as far up, for a fact," said Nat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Scott, with pardonable pride, since he had developed into
a pretty good climber.</p>

<p>"Well, that mountain is not so tall as ours; but then it
may be even rougher, for all we know," observed Elmer.
"I picked out this one because it was so high, and I always
want to tackle the hardest job, if I've got any choice. It
makes you feel all the better if you win out. But come on,
fellows, let's pitch in. Given one more good hour's work,
and I think we ought to be pretty near the crown."</p>

<p>"I hope so!" sighed poor Larry, who was puffing still,
and rubbing his leg where he had hurt it a little on the
previous day; though it was nothing so bad as Red's injury,
aggravated as it had been by his stubborn determination to
return to the lone hut and accompany the relief party.</p>

<p>Once more they struggled upward. Sometimes they
found the going so very difficult that they were obliged to
give each other a helping hand.</p>

<p>Of course the view grew finer the higher they went.</p>

<p>"Say, Elmer," remarked Toby, as they halted later on
to get their breath; "d'ye suppose now we'll be able to
glimpse dear old Hickory Ridge when we get up to the top
of this mole hill?"</p>

<p>"Sure we will," replied the leader, cheerily. "And
that alone ought to pay us for all our trouble. We've only
been away a couple of days or so, but I reckon it seems an
age to a lot of us, since we saw the home folks."</p>

<p>There was an ominous silence after that remark. Doubtless
every scout was allowing his thoughts to roam tenderly
back to that beloved home which he knew sheltered those
who were so dear to his heart. And possibly, unseen by
his fellows, a tear may even have rolled unbidden down
more than one cheek. For they were but boys, after all, and
same of them had never even been so far away from the
home nest before.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Elmer proved to be a true prophet, for ere the full hour
was up even the doubting Larry was obliged to confess that
they had gained a point not far from the summit.</p>

<p>This seemed to inspire the laggards to renewed efforts, so
that presently, with loud cries of delight and admiration,
the whole bunch struggled to the apex and had the view of
their lives around them.</p>

<p>"Ain't this just too grand for anything?" gasped
Larry, as he squatted down on a stone and tried to pick
out the distant village on the ridge where home lay.</p>

<p>The others were doing the same; and all manner of exclamations
followed, as this one or that discovered familiar
landmarks, by means of which their untrained eyes could
find the one particular spot about which their thoughts
clustered just then.</p>

<p>It was not far from noon, and when Elmer declared that
they had well earned the right to eat the hearty luncheon
carried along, he was greeted with cries of joy: for it was
a jolly hungry batch of scouts that gathered on that mountain
top.</p>

<p>While they ate they discovered that their mates had also
managed to reach their goal. But no communication was
attempted until they had thoroughly rested.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Garrabrant started operations himself, after
which he probably handed the flags over to the scout who
was to make the first test of his knowledge along the line
of wigwagging a message, and receiving a reply.</p>

<p>It proved to be interesting work, and all the boys with
Elmer declared that it held a peculiar fascination and
charm about it. Of course, in war times, such business must
carry along with it more or less danger. They could easily
picture how an operator must take great risks first of all
to mount to some exposed position, where his flag could
readily be seen, and then keep up a constant signaling with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
another flagman far away, while the enemy would doubtless
be making every effort to break up the serious communications
that might spell disaster for their cause.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, it won't take us near so long to go down the
mountain as it did to climb up here," remarked Larry, with
satisfaction in his voice.</p>

<p>"All the same," remarked Elmer, "every fellow has
got to be mighty careful just how he goes. No rushing
things, you understand. It's easier to take a tumble going
down than coming up. And we want no more cripples on
this trip."</p>

<p>About three o'clock they started to descend from the peak.
Every boy had to just tear himself away, after one last look
at the distant ridge that lay bathed in the warm sunshine.
And no one had a word to say for quite a time.</p>

<p>The descent was made in safety, though several times one
of the boys would slip on a piece of loose shale; and once
Larry might have had a severe fall only that Elmer, happening
to be close beside him at the time, shot out a hand
and clutched him as he was plunging headlong, after catching
his heel in a root.</p>

<p>They all breathed a sigh of relief when the bottom of the
mountain was reached. After that the going was much
easier, and they soon drew near the camp.</p>

<p>"Wonder if the other fellows made as quick a getdown
as we did?" remarked Toby, who was hobbling along, footsore,
and with his muscles paining from the many severe
strains they had been compelled to endure during the day;
but only too glad to realize that he would soon arrive where
he could once more be in touch with that wonderful sky
traveler that had so fortunately dropped into their hands.</p>

<p>"I think it will be pretty near a tie," laughed Elmer;
"for just a bit ago I had a glimpse of them, where the
timber opened up, and I judged that they were as close to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
home and supper as we are. Put your best leg forward,
boys, and don't let on that any of you are near tuckered
out. Where's your pride, Larry? Brace up, and look as if
you felt as fresh as a daisy!"</p>

<p>Larry tried to obey; but it was hard to smile when he
felt as though he had been "drawn through a straw," as
he declared.</p>

<p>"Listen!" cried Elmer, five minutes later, throwing up
his hand for silence.</p>

<p>"It's Ginger, and he's yelling to beat the band!" exclaimed
Toby.</p>

<p>"Oh! I wonder what's happened!" gasped Jasper.</p>

<p>"Run for all you're worth, fellows!" said Elmer, starting
off himself at full speed.</p>

<p>Quickly they broke cover, and neared the camp, to see
the other party close by, also on the run. Ginger was
dancing up and down, still whooping things up, while Red
stood just outside of a tent looking startled and puzzled.</p>

<p>"What's that Ginger's yelling?" called Toby, and it
thrilled them as they heard.</p>

<p>"'Twar de debble dat time nigh got me! He's gwine tuh
grab us all away in de chariot ob fire! I'se a gone coon,
I is! Runnin' ain't no use;" and Ginger threw himself
on his knees with clasped hands and rolling eyes.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE HAIRY THIEF THAT WALKED ON TWO LEGS.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">No</span> wonder the returned scouts stared, hardly daring to
believe their eyes and ears. Some of them of course
thought Ginger might have gone out of his head. Only
on the preceding night had Elmer been telling them what
queer antics animals out on the plains go through with,
when they have been eating the loco weed.</p>

<p>There were a few who seemed to have a hazy suspicion
that possibly Red might be concerned in this strange fright
on the part of poor Ginger. True, the boy with the lame leg
had apparently just dragged himself out of the tent, and
the look on his face under that fiery shock of hair would
indicate astonishment as genuine as their own; but then,
how were they to know but what this had been assumed?</p>

<p>Mr. Garrabrant, however, made direct for the moaning
and wabbling negro, who had fallen on his knees, and with
clasped hands was bowing back and forth in an agony of
fear.</p>

<p>"Here, what's the matter with you, Ginger?" he demanded,
catching hold of the other, and while Ginger gave
a little screech at first, upon turning his rolling eyes upward
he appeared to recognize the genial face of the young
scout master.</p>

<p>"Oh! Mistah Grabant, am dat youse?" he cried, seizing
hold of the other's arm. "I'se mighty glad tuh see
yuh, suh, 'deed an' I is. Am it gone foh suah?"</p>

<p>"What gone?" demanded Mr. Garrabrant, sternly.
"See here, Ginger, have you kept a black bottle hidden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
away all this time while we have been in camp?" For he
had a sudden inspiration that possibly Ginger might be
addicted to the failing that besets so many of his color.</p>

<p>"'Deed an' 'deed an' I ain't touched a single drap,
suh," declared the demoralized one; "'clar tuh goodness
if I has. It war dar, jes' ober yander, whar de box ob
crackers am alyin' right now. An' he scolded me, suh,
foh interferin' wid de liberties he am takin' wid dem provisions,
dat he did! Ugh! tuh t'ink dat I'd lib tuh set
eyes on de Ole Nick!"</p>

<p>"But what makes you think it was Satan? Perhaps it
was only some wandering hobo who thought he saw a good
chance to steal something to eat?" and the scout master
sought to hold Ginger's roving eyes fastened upon his own
orbs, so as to rivet his attention, and secure a coherent
answer to his question.</p>

<p>"Sho! dat was no human animal, suh!" exclaimed Ginger,
earnestly. "He done hab a cover ob red hair, an'
de wickedest grin on his face yuh ebber see. Reckon I
knows de debble w'en I sees him."</p>

<p>"Well, from what you say, Ginger, this queer visitor
seems to have had a very human weakness for crackers,"
remarked Mr. Garrabrant, smiling. "Was he carrying that
package of biscuit when you saw him first?"</p>

<p>"Yas, suh, dat an' two more ob dem same. He drap it
'case he couldn't hold de lot, an' walk away too. Yuh see,
suh, I war cleaning some fish dat de boys dey fotched in
las' ebenin', an' which we nebber use foh breakfast dis
mornin'. Den I tink I hyah some queer noise in de camp,
an' I starts up dis a ways. 'Twar den dat de hairy ole
critter steps outen de store tent, and jabbers at me. I
was skeered nigh 'bout stiff, suh, 'clar tuh goodness I was."</p>

<p>"Still, you shouted, for we heard you, Ginger!" said
Mr. Garrabrant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>"Reckons I did do sumpin' dat way, boss," admitted
the negro, a faint grin striving to make its appearance on
his ebony face. "Dat was jes' when de Ole Harry, he was
asteppin' into de bushes, acarryin' two ob de boxes ob
crackers in his arms."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say he walked erect, on two legs?"
asked the scout master.</p>

<p>"Shore he did, suh, right along, ahuggin' de grub wid
one arm, an' shakin' his fist at me wid de udder."</p>

<p>"Now you talk as though it <i>must</i> have been a man&mdash;perhaps
a wild man who may have been living in these woods
for years?" suggested Mr. Garrabrant.</p>

<p>But Ginger shook his head in an obstinate fashion, saying:</p>

<p>"I knows right well dat he wa'n't dat, suh; I'se dead
suah 'bout it!"</p>

<p>"But why do you say that; what proof have you it was
not some sort of man, Ginger?"</p>

<p>"<i>'Case he done hab a tail, suh!</i>" cried the other, triumphantly.</p>

<p>Mr. Garrabrant smiled, and gave Elmer, who was close
at his elbow all the while, a knowing wink.</p>

<p>"Well," he remarked, "that tail business would seem to
settle one thing, Ginger. Unless this turns out to be the
long-sought Missing Link, our visitor could hardly have
been a human being. He was evidently an animal of <i>some</i>
sort. Get that idea of the Old Nick out of your head.
Listen to me, Ginger, and try to remember; did he say
anything to you?"</p>

<p>"Yas, sah, he did, lots!" answered the black man,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Suppose you tell us what it was, then?" suggested the
scout master, quickly.</p>

<p>"Dar's wha' yuh got me, Mistah Grabant," replied the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
other, reluctantly. "Yuh see, suh, I nebber did git much
schoolin' down in Virginny, whah I was bawn an' brought
up. Nebber did go to college an' larn de dead langwidges."</p>

<p>"Oh! then this creature talked to you in Greek, or possibly
Hebrew, did he? In other words, he chattered in an
unknown tongue! Well, how about you, Oscar; did you
happen to catch a glimpse of Ginger's uninvited guest?"
and Mr. Garrabrant turned suddenly on Red, as though
wishing to make positive that this were not a clever trick he
might have been playing on the terrified black man.</p>

<p>"No, sir," came the ready response. "I was busy inside
when I heard Ginger give that war whoop! I thought
he might have burned himself at the fire, and I hurt my
game pin like fun when I tried to run out. All I saw was
the coon down on his marrowbones asinging that same
tune about the 'debble.' That's all I know, sir, give you
my word for it."</p>

<p>"All right, I believe you, Oscar," continued the scout
master, plainly disturbed by this new mystery that had
descended upon the camp, yet pretending to make light of
it because he did not wish to alarm the boys under his
charge. "And now, Ginger, can you point out to me just
the spot where your strange friend vanished?"</p>

<p>"'Deed an' 'deed he ain't no friend ob mine, suh, gibes
yuh my word foh dat," replied the other, solemnly.
"Right ober yandah, suh, whah dem bushes hangs low. An'
I declars tuh Moses, suh, I don't know right now whedder
de ugly ole sinner he jes' step intuh de bushes, or go up in
a cloud ob fire like de prophet ob old."</p>

<p>Several of the more impulsive scouts started to hurry
in that direction.</p>

<p>"Stop, boys!" called the scout master instantly. "Come
back here, please. Once before you succeeded in trampling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
all sign out, so that Elmer was unable to pick up any
clue. Now, I want just Elmer and Mark to go over there,
to investigate. After that has been done they will report
to me. And now, let's settle down in camp, for I know
you are all tired. Supper is the next thing on the program."</p>

<p>Elmer, accompanied by his nearest chum, immediately
walked carefully over in the direction of the spot which
Ginger had indicated. They bent low, and seemed to be
deeply interested in certain tracks they had found.</p>

<p>Of course the boys shot many curious glances that way,
but they knew better than to disobey the positive orders
given by their chief. Discipline is one of the first things
taught among the Boy Scouts.</p>

<p>About this time Dr. Ted and Jack Armitage got back
from a day at the cabin. They had much to tell about what
they had occupied themselves in doing all the time, preparing
things so that in a few days the family could be
moved, for Mr. Garrabrant had fully decided to take the
sick man and his "kiddies" down in one of the boats to
Rockaway, where they could be looked after until the expedition
returned.</p>

<p>It was getting dusk before Elmer and his chum joined
the others. They did not give out any information, and to
the inquiries of their curious mates returned only vague
smiles and nods.</p>

<p>Supper was eaten with more or less clatter of tongues.
There were so many interesting subjects claiming their
attention that the boys hardly knew which to discuss first.</p>

<p>When, however, the meal was about done, Mr. Garrabrant
asked Elmer to step aside with him for a short time.</p>

<p>"Here, let us sit down on this convenient log, Elmer,"
remarked the scout master. "And please tell me what you
found."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>"We had no difficulty in discovering the tracks, sir," replied
the boy, whose experience on a Canadian prairie
farm and ranch made him a valuable addition to the ranks
of the Boy Scouts at such a time.</p>

<p>"Was it a man or an animal?" asked the gentleman, as
though eager to have that mooted point settled immediately.</p>

<p>"Oh! an animal, sir, there can be no doubt of that," replied
Elmer, smiling. "But those tracks puzzle me the
worst kind. I know what the trail of a panther looks like,
also that of a fox, a wolf, a bear, a deer, a coyote, a wildcat&mdash;but
this was entirely different from any of these. It
resembled the footprint of a human being&mdash;a child&mdash;more
than anything I ever saw."</p>

<p>Mr. Garrabrant smiled, and nodded his head.</p>

<p>"I've got an idea," he said, "but go on, and tell me
what else you learned. Then I'll put you wise to what I
suspect."</p>

<p>"Well," the boy continued, "the queer thing about it
is that Ginger was quite right when he said the thing
walked on two legs. I could only find the marks of that
many. Now, I've seen a bear do that stunt, and educated
dogs, but no other animal outside of a circus."</p>

<p>"How about a monkey?" asked the scout master,
quietly.</p>

<p>"Oh! Mr. Garrabrant, how could such an animal get up
here? Monkeys live in tropical countries only. But I
can see that you've got an idea. Please let me hear it."</p>

<p>"Listen then, Elmer," the other went on, seriously.
"Now, I happen to know that just a month ago a certain
gentleman named Colonel Hitchens, living on a country
place he calls Caldwell, just a mile outside the town of
Rockaway, lost a pet monkey that had been taught to do
a lot of funny antics. The gentleman was an old traveler,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
and had brought the animal himself from some foreign
land. I remember his telling me how he caught him, by
filling some cocoanut shells with strong drink, and getting
the animal stupid."</p>

<p>"Oh! that must be it, then!" exclaimed Elmer, laughing,
while the look of bewilderment left his face. "No
wonder the tracks were a riddle to me. I've never as yet
had the pleasure of hunting monkeys, or Barbary apes,
or gorillas. Yes, sir, the more I think of it, the more I
believe that you've hit the truth. It must have been a
monkey, hungry for some of the things he had been used
to when held a prisoner at Colonel Hitchens'."</p>

<p>"I saw the beast perform once," Mr. Garrabrant went
on, "and he was really a marvel. He was a big chap, too,
hairy and ugly. When he chattered and scowled he certainly
was enough to give one a shiver. No wonder then
that he frightened poor Ginger almost into convulsions.
No wonder our factotum believed he had seen the Old Nick.
But what had he better do about it, Elmer?"</p>

<p>"That's just what I wanted to speak with you about,
sir," the boy remarked, with considerable eagerness.
"Now the chances are that, having once made a raid on
our store tent, this monkey will come again another time,
perhaps even to-night."</p>

<p>"That sounds reasonable," replied the scout master, nodding
his head. "By the way, I just happened to remember
the monkey's name. It fitted him pretty well, too, as
you'll admit when you see him. Diablo it was."</p>

<p>"Just think of it, sir, just the name Ginger gave him,
too. But Mark and I have decided to set a trap to catch
him. We'll fix it so that if the monkey tries to enter the
store tent again he'll set off a trigger, and some queer results
will follow. For one thing he'll find himself caught
up in the loop of a rope, and held, kicking, off the ground<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
until we can come to corral him. Then, if it happens to be
in the night, the falling of the trigger will set a flashlight
going, and Mark's camera, placed for the occasion, will
take a picture of the trespasser."</p>

<p>"That sounds fine, Elmer," laughed the scout master.
"Now, I leave the matter in your hands entirely. Do what
you think best, and I wish you success."</p>

<p>"How about telling the boys, sir?" asked Elmer.</p>

<p>Mr. Garrabrant thought it over a moment.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you'd better take the whole bunch into your
confidence," he said, presently. "They are deeply interested,
you know, and if kept in ignorance possibly some
one might stumble across your plans, and upset every calculation."</p>

<p>And so, when Elmer returned to the fire, he had the entire
bunch listening, their eyes round with wonder, as they
learned what had been discovered, and also of the bright
plans their chums had arranged looking to the capture of
Diablo.</p>

<p>Only Ginger was evidently disturbed. He scratched his
head as he listened, as if he could hardly believe what he
saw had been of this earth, and the idea of Elmer being
so rash as to want to try and make a prisoner of the Evil
One gave the ignorant negro a cold shiver. Doubtless he
would make sure to find a snug place to sleep that night,
where nothing could get at him. His mind was still filled
with foolish notions concerning that "chariot of fire" in
which he might be carried out of this world into the Great
Unknown.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>LAYING A GHOST.</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Well</span>, Elmer," remarked Mr. Garrabrant, the next
morning, as he came out of his tent and met the young
scout leader face to face, "I must have slept unusually
sound last night, for the alarm failed to awaken me!"</p>

<p>"There was no alarm, sir," smiled Elmer.</p>

<p>"Meaning that we did not have the pleasure of a second
visit from Diablo, the educated monkey, is that it?"
asked the scout master, pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," the boy went on, "Diablo must have secured
enough rations in his first raid to last him for twenty-four
hours. But Mark and myself do not think of giving
our job up yet awhile. We expect to catch a likeness of
our hairy visitor, even if the trap fails to work, and hold
him a prisoner. I suppose Colonel Hitchens would be
very glad to have the beast back, if it turns out that this
is Diablo?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure of it, and as he is a wealthy man, no doubt
he would willingly pay a round sum to those who would
return his pet," Mr. Garrabrant declared.</p>

<p>"Oh! we were not thinking of that, sir, I give you my
word," declared Elmer; "but possibly, if we did happen
to succeed, the gentleman might be willing to do something
for poor Abe in return for our restoring his pet."</p>

<p>The scout master looked keenly at Elmer, and then thrust
out his hand impulsively.</p>

<p>"That was well said, my boy," he remarked, with a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
quiver in his voice. "I am proud to know that you feel
that way toward the unfortunate. And I give you my
word, if you are so fortunate as to capture Diablo, I'll
convince Colonel Hitchens that it is his <i>duty</i> to do a lot
for Abe and his little flock. That boy is made of the right
stuff, I'm sure, and ought to have the advantages of an
education. I'm going to see that he has his chance."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, just to think of a kid not over six years old
being able to set a muskrat trap, and actually take skins.
Why, I know a lot about the little varmints, and I give
you my word, sir, they're pretty sharp. It takes a bright
boy to outwit an old seasoned muskrat. He showed me
quite a lot of skins he had cured, of course under his father's
directions."</p>

<p>"And then that girl, Little Lou&mdash;think of her doing all
the cooking for the family ever since her mother was taken
away?" continued the gentleman. "She's a darling, if
I ever saw one. I grew quite fond of her, and mean to
see more of them all. But I ought to be laying out the
program for to-day's work."</p>

<p>"What are we to try to-day, sir?" asked Elmer, who,
as second in command, had privileges in talking with the
scout master that none of the other lads dared assume.</p>

<p>"Well, as it promises to be a warm day, we might try
the swimming test for one thing," replied Mr. Garrabrant,
thoughtfully. "At the same time there is that feat of
landing a big fish with a rod and a small line, the said fish
being of course an active boy, who does his best to break
away. While we're at it, we may as well go through our
usual formula whereby anyone who has been nearly
drowned may be resuscitated again. And last, but not
least, we can have Dr. Ted give us his talk on first aid to
the injured. He will get back in good time if he leaves
after lunch for the Morris cabin."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think Chatz is waiting to speak to you, sir," remarked
Elmer, who had been noticing the Southern lad hovering
near for some little time, looking queerly in their direction.</p>

<p>"Is that so?" remarked Mr. Garrabrant. "Now I hope
he hasn't been seeing more of his hobgoblins. That is about
the only weakness Charles seems to have. Otherwise I find
him a very sensible lad. If only he could be cured of his
belief in the supernatural it would be a good thing."</p>

<p>"Well," laughed Elmer, "some of us would be only
too glad of the chance to cure him. Shall I go away, and
let him have an interview, sir?"</p>

<p>"No, remain, and hear what Charles has to say. It may
be I shall need your services. This time the tracks of
the ghost may not have been trampled out of sight, and
you can give a guess at its character. I never in all my
life knew of so many queer happenings inside of so short
a time."</p>

<p>The scout master beckoned toward Chatz, and obeying the
mandate the Southern boy came quickly forward.</p>

<p>"You wish to speak with me, Charles, I imagine?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the other, with a frown on his brow.</p>

<p>"Has something happened again to disturb you?" inquired
Mr. Garrabrant.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Last night, I presume, since you would have spoken
before, had it happened yesterday?" the scout master continued,
quietly.</p>

<p>"Last night it was, sir. I saw IT again!" remarked
Chatz, appearing to swallow something that was in his
throat.</p>

<p>"Oh! you mean that mysterious white object which appeared
to you on the other occasion, and seemed to assume
all the characteristics of a supernatural visitor? In other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
words, Charles, your pet ghost?" remarked Mr. Garrabrant.</p>

<p>The boy flushed, but held his ground.</p>

<p>"Of course," he said, slowly, "I understand what a
contempt you have for any such idea, sir; and indeed, I
only wish it could be shown to me that this is only some
natural object, and not of the other world. I'd be too
glad to know it. I hate to think I'm given to such ideas,
but they seem to be a part of my nature, and I can't help
it, try as I may."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps we may be able to assist you, Charles,"
returned the genial scout master, laying a hand on the lad's
shoulder in a way that quite won his confidence. "Now
tell me what you saw, when and where, also what it looked
like."</p>

<p>"I think it was in about the same quarter as before,
sir. My watch happened to come late in the night this
time, in fact just before dawn broke. I heard again that
blood-curdling sound, a plain 'woof'! and raising my
head I could just make it out in the darkness. It was white,
as before, and it moved! Then all of a sudden it seemed
to vanish most mysteriously."</p>

<p>"Well, did the other sentry see anything, Charles?"
asked Mr. Garrabrant.</p>

<p>"We had arranged it all between us, sir, Ty Collins and
myself. And he will tell you, sir, that he saw just what I
did," replied Chatz, earnestly.</p>

<p>"That sounds as though you might have seen <i>something</i>,
then," smiled Mr. Garrabrant. "And Elmer, you were so
successful in picking out those other tracks, suppose you
try again."</p>

<p>"Shall I go now, sir?" asked the other, readily.</p>

<p>"I would like you to. If you find a trail, you might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
follow it up a bit. Perhaps Charles would like to accompany
you."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I would, if you didn't object," replied the
Southern lad, quickly.</p>

<p>"Very well," nodded the scout master. "Report to me
when you are through, Elmer."</p>

<p>So the two boys went away together. Some of the others,
seeing them bending down as though examining the ground,
made a move as if to join them, but Mr. Garrabrant was
watching, and called them back.</p>

<p>He saw Elmer, followed by the wondering Chatz, walk
slowly away, his head bent low, as though he were following
some sort of trail.</p>

<p>And the scout master laughed softly to himself as he
muttered:</p>

<p>"I fancy Charles is about to have a little surprise, now
that Elmer has found a trail to follow. Because, as a true
believer in ghosts, he must realize that anything that leaves
traces behind can hardly claim supernatural qualities."</p>

<p>Twenty minutes afterwards, shortly before breakfast was
ready, the two boys came back again. Chatz was smiling
in a queer way, but Elmer looked like a sphinx.</p>

<p>The latter, obeying a beckoning finger, hurried over to
join Mr. Garrabrant.</p>

<p>"Unless my eyes deceive me, Elmer," remarked the gentleman,
with a quizzical expression on his handsome face,
"you've been up to your old tricks again, and finding
out things. How is it, do you plead guilty to the charge?"</p>

<p>"I guess I'll just have to, sir," replied the boy, also
smiling now.</p>

<p>"Then you found a trail, did you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Elmer went on, "a positive one; though the
ground was that hard a greenhorn could never have seen
it. And while Chatz kept at my side I don't think he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
dreamed what I was doing as we went along. Then, about
a hundred yards away I heard that same queer 'woof'
he spoke of."</p>

<p>"It didn't give you a shock, I warrant, Elmer?" remarked
the scout master.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, sir, I've had too much to do with cattle
not to recognize the snort of a startled cow! And that
was what we saw just ahead of us. She had been lying
down, chewing her cud, and our coming had caused her to
get on her feet."</p>

<p>"Did she happen to have a white face, Elmer?" laughed
Mr. Garrabrant.</p>

<p>"Just what she did, sir," the boy replied. "Chatz
looked at me, and turned pale, then red; after which he
laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks. I think we
put quite a spoke in his spook wheel, sir. He won't be so
ready to believe in supernatural visitors after this."</p>

<p>"It was well done, Elmer, and I thank you for it. Now,
let's to breakfast, for we have a strenuous day before us,"
and the scout master led the way to the place where a
bounteous meal had been spread for the entire troop of
scouts.</p>

<p>During the morning the swimming tests were started,
and Mr. Garrabrant, who was a splendid swimmer himself,
took charge of matters. Some excellent work was done,
and the timid ones taught how to strike out, to float, and to
tread water, as well as various races inaugurated that were
full of fun.</p>

<p>After that came the wonderful fishing contest, where the
boys did what they could to land one of their mates who
played the part of a hooked fish, fighting to get away, just
as a monster scaly prize like a tarpon might have done.</p>

<p>Of course Elmer was the leader in this game, for he had
had much more experience as a sportsman than any of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
rest, but there were several who proved themselves good
seconds in the trial, and who would make the winner look
to his laurels in the near future.</p>

<p>That brought them to noon, and matters were allowed to
simmer while they got busy cooking a lunch to satisfy the
tremendous appetites that the vigorous labor of the morning
had developed.</p>

<p>Ted and Lil Artha expected to take a tramp over to the
lone cabin during the afternoon. They could not start,
however, until the concluding work of the day had been
attended to. As this was to be "first aid to the injured"
the presence of the only budding doctor in camp would be
required, in order to explain many important things connected
with this valuable adjunct to scout lore.</p>

<p>It was possibly nearly three o'clock before the two lads
got started. But that did not matter much, for by this
time Ted had become very familiar with the way of the
blazed trail, and could follow it "with his eyes blindfolded,"
as he boastingly remarked, though Elmer knew
this was hardly so.</p>

<p>Some of the scouts were out on the lake, trying to coax
a mess of fish to come closer to the fire and get warmed up.
The taste of browned trout haunted them, and even Mr.
Garrabrant admitted that the way Elmer cooked the fish,
they were finer than any he had ever eaten. It was to
have the salt pork in a hot frying pan, until it had been
well tried out, then having rolled each fish in cracker
crumbs, or corn meal if the former were not handy, they
were placed over the fire in the pan to brown.</p>

<p>Another time Elmer broiled the fish, and the boys were
uncertain as to which method they liked most. When they
ate the trout cooked one way that excelled, and next day
when the other method was tried they believed it could not
be equalled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>Evening was not far away when a shout attracted the
attention of all those in camp. Even the few who happened
to be inside the tents came hurrying out to see what it
meant.</p>

<p>"That must have been Lil Artha," declared Elmer immediately.
"Nobody else has so loud a whoop. Yes, there
they come, he and Ted, hurrying down the side of the
mountain. They seem to be in something of a hurry, too."</p>

<p>"And look at Ted waving his hand, will you?" exclaimed
Toby, beginning to get excited himself. "He
wouldn't act that way, fellers, except that there's something
gone wrong. Gee! I hope now the old man ain't
been taken sudden, and handed in his checks! That would
be tough on the kids, now!"</p>

<p>Mr. Garrabrant heard what Toby said, but made no remark.
He was waiting for the coming of the two scouts
who had gone across the mountain on their errand of mercy.</p>

<p>The long-legged Lil Artha could have easily outrun his
comrade had he chosen, but he made no effort to do so.
Still, as they drew closer, it could be easily seen that both
boys showed unmistakable evidences of some tremendous
excitement. And, naturally, their fellow scouts almost trembled
with eagerness to learn what could have happened to
affect them in this way.</p>

<p>Three minutes later and they drew up in front of the
group, panting, flushed&mdash;their eyes sparkling with suppressed
news.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>TAKEN BY SURPRISE.</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">What's</span> the matter with you boys?" demanded the
scout master, as Ted and Lil Artha drew up in front of
him.</p>

<p>"They've come in on Abe, sir, and are threatening to
do all sorts of awful things to him, the great beasts!" exclaimed
the tall runner, between pants.</p>

<p>"Speak plainer, please," Mr. Garrabrant said, sternly,
so as to subdue some of the rampant excitement that threatened
to impede a clear flow of words. "Who came in on
Abe&mdash;was it animals you meant, or men?"</p>

<p>"Men, thir, and two of the toughest you ever thaw," Ted
managed to declare. "They were eating up all the stuff
we've been at such pains to carry over, and threatened the
thick man with all thorts of trouble because he thaid he
didn't have thuch a thing as a drop of whisky in hith
place."</p>

<p>"Two hoboes, most likely," muttered the scout master,
as his firm teeth came together with a snap that meant business.</p>

<p>"That's what I thaid, thir, but Lil Artha, he theemed to
think he recognized the bullies as a couple of jail birds,"
Ted went on.</p>

<p>"You see, sir," Arthur spoke up as he saw Mr. Garrabrant
look questioningly at him, "I remembered seeing the
pictures of those two rascals that broke into some house
near Rockaway last Spring. They had it posted up in police<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
headquarters at Hickory Ridge when I went in to pay
for our dog license. And I don't soon forget faces, sir, or
names either, for that matter. Unless I miss my guess these
two ugly scamps were Jim Rowdy and Bill Harris, wanted
bad in Rockville, with a reward offered for their capture."</p>

<p>"You may be right, Theodore," observed the scout
master, seriously. "They were never caught, I remember.
The strange thing about it was, that the house they
entered and robbed was that of my friend, Colonel
Hitchens."</p>

<p>"The same gentleman who owned the lost monkey?"
cried one of the scouts.</p>

<p>"Exactly. But this is a serious matter for us, boys,"
the scout master went on. "Our new friends are in danger,
for there can be no telling to what extremes such
unprincipled scoundrels might go, once they started. Perhaps
they may have an old grudge against Abe, for the
boys say they were threatening him. And it gives me a
cold chill to think of these two innocent children being in
their power."</p>

<p>"Will you go over, thir, and try to do thomething?"
asked Ted, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Surely," came the instant reply. "I would be unworthy
to call myself a man if I failed in my duty there.
But tell us more, please, how did you first learn of the presence
of these ruffians there, and did you give away the fact
that you had discovered them?"</p>

<p>"Oh! no, thir, they didn't thee us a bit!" exclaimed
Ted.</p>

<p>"We happened to hear loud voices, you see, sir, when
we were close to the joint," said Arthur, bent on having
his share in the recital.</p>

<p>"Tho we crept up, as thly as any Indian could have
done," added Ted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>"And peeked in at the window, just like we did that
night we went over in a bunch," the tall lad remarked.</p>

<p>"Then we thaw what it meant," Ted continued, catching
his breath again. "Those two big bullies had been eating,
and made poor Little Lou cook nigh everything we left
there yesterday. Why, they were as hungry as hogs, I
guess."</p>

<p>"And they kept on shaking their fists at poor Abe, who
was lying on his cot, too weak to do anything," Lil Artha
took up the narrative. "He seemed to be atryin' to get
them to let up on him, but he looked nearly done for."</p>

<p>"Then we just crawled away again," Ted concluded,
"and run pretty near all the way back, because we knew
you would want uth to report. Lil Artha wanted to tackle
'em by ourselves, but it was thilly to think we could do
anything against a pair of desperate jailbirds like that."</p>

<p>"Under the circumstances I commend your discretion,
Theodore," said the scout master, "though the readiness
of Arthur to take chances in a good cause does him credit
too. But let's hurry and eat supper. I can be arranging
my plans meanwhile, and selecting those I would want to
accompany me over the mountain."</p>

<p>"I hope you will take me, sir!" exclaimed Matty Eggleston.</p>

<p>"And me, too, sir!" exclaimed half a dozen others, in
a breath.</p>

<p>Even the two returned scouts were anxious not to be left
behind.</p>

<p>"I'm not tired a little bit, Mr. Garrabrant!" Lil Artha
hastened to declare, and Dr. Ted said ditto to that.</p>

<p>"Give me time, boys, to consider," the gentleman had
said, waving them away.</p>

<p>Supper was quickly announced, and they made record
time in getting away with a fine meal. No one even thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
to remark upon the fact that it tasted better than any
meal ever eaten under a roof, which had come to be a
standing saying with the scouts by this time.</p>

<p>Many an anxious look was cast toward Mr. Garrabrant.
They saw that his eyes had been roving around the circle,
as though he might be mentally choosing those who were
to be favored with a place at his side during this new
errand of mercy across the mountain that frowned down
upon the camp. And every scout was eager to be among
the lucky ones, even the usually timid Jasper Merriweather.</p>

<p>"I have decided upon the following to accompany me:
Ginger will go, because he is a man, and will be apt to
inspire more or less respect in the hearts of the two rascals.
Then there are Elmer, Matty, Larry Billings, Arthur
Stansbury, Charlie Maxfield, and Theodore. I am
taking him because we may happen to have need of his
professional services," and when Mr. Garrabrant said this
as though he really meant it, who could blame Ted for
unconsciously pushing out his chest a bit with pride?</p>

<p>There could be no demur to this ultimatum. So those
who were fated to remain did what they could to get their
more fortunate chums ready for the excursion. The stoutest
cudgels possible were hunted up, and handed over,
with recommendations as to their convincing qualities if
once applied to a stubborn head.</p>

<p>"However," said the scout master, as they were ready
to leave, "I am in hopes that we can take the rascals by
surprise, so that there will not be any real necessity for
violence. The rest of you stick by the camp while we are
gone. You can wait up for us, if you want."</p>

<p>"Sure we will, sir!" declared one. "We couldn't any
more sleep than water can run up hill."</p>

<p>"And don't any of you meddle with the little trap we've<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
got set by the store tent, remember, please," Elmer flung
over his shoulder as he was marching away.</p>

<p>Then they were off.</p>

<p>Counting Mr. Garrabrant and Ginger, they were eight
in all, surely a strong enough bunch to overcome two men,
if only they might take the ruffians by surprise. Ginger
was far from being a coward when it came to things he
could understand. This fact was known to Mr. Garrabrant,
which was the reason he took the colored man and brother
along. Besides, his heft might have considerable influence
in causing the two men to submit.</p>

<p>As before, they carried a couple of lanterns. The light
from these came in very handy to save the boys from many
an ugly tumble, where roots lay across their path or rocks
cropped up in the way.</p>

<p>They conversed in whispers only. And as they finally
drew near the lone cabin, even this style of talk was stopped
by order of Mr. Garrabrant, so that they now crept along
in absolute silence.</p>

<p>He had told the boys of his plans, so that each member
of the little party knew just what was expected of him.</p>

<p>Presently they caught sight of a dim light ahead. Then
came the sound of loud and gruff voices. This convinced
them that the two rascals had not left the cabin.</p>

<p>Creeping closer, they could finally see through the little
opening. And thus the scout master was enabled to complete
the plan he had arranged.</p>

<p>When he gave the word, Ginger and the boys were to
jump in by way of the open door. Meantime he expected
to thrust his arm through the window and cover the pair
of desperate rascals with the revolver he had brought along.
Mr. Garrabrant gave evidence of being in deadly earnest,
for he knew that was a serious matter that confronted them,
and one not to be handled with gloves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>When he heard Elmer give the cry of the whip-poor-will
three times he knew they were all in their places. Accordingly,
he suddenly thrust his arm through the small window
that had no glass, and covered one of the men with
his weapon.</p>

<p>"Stand still, both of you! The hut is surrounded, and
if you try to escape or offer resistance it will be the worse
for you! Seize them, men!"</p>

<p>As Mr. Garrabrant called this out, and the two astonished
scoundrels sat there, utterly unable to collect their senses,
such was the complete surprise, through the doorway tumbled
a crowd that hurled itself upon them. Before they
could grasp the fact that with one exception these were
only half-grown boys, wearing the khaki uniforms of the
scouts, and not regular soldiers, the men had their hands
tied behind them.</p>

<p>As they realized how completely they had been caught
napping both of them started on a string of hard words, and
looked daggers at their young captors.</p>

<p>"Stop that, now!" Mr. Garrabrant exclaimed, as he
made his appearance in the hut, "or I shall be under the
painful necessity of putting gags between your teeth. Not
another word from either of you, remember!"</p>

<p>Perhaps they recognized the tone of authority, or it may
have been that they had no desire to force him to put his
threat into execution. At any rate, they took it out in deep
mumblings after that.</p>

<p>The scout master saw to it himself that their lashings
were secure. Some of the boys had carried along a new
supply of food for Abe and his family, understanding the
inroads that had been made in their limited stock.</p>

<p>The sick man was full of gratitude for this second rescue
on the part of his new-found friends. He told them
how these two scoundrels had come to his cabin and taken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
possession&mdash;that he knew who they were, but that some
years back they had been honest charcoal burners the same
as himself.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Garrabrant, "they graduated from
that honest class some time ago, and have made names for
themselves as yeggmen and thieves. They are badly wanted
right now in Rockaway, where some months back they
robbed a residence, and nearly killed a butler who caught
them in the act, and recognized them too. Boys, when you
feel rested, we will be on our way back to camp with our
prisoners. To-morrow I shall take them down the river
in a boat, and deliver them over to the authorities."</p>

<p>All of which intelligence made the gloom gather deeper
on the hard countenances of Jim Rowdy and Bill Harris.</p>

<p>It took twice as long for them to make the march back
to camp as when they went toward the lone cabin. In the
first place, some of the boys were almost exhausted, particularly
Ted and Lil Artha, who were covering the ground
for the second time since noon. Then again, the two men,
having their arms bound behind their backs, stumbled so
often that they had to be helped.</p>

<p>But along about eleven they came in sight of the cheery
camp fire, and how very welcome it did look too. The
boys greeted it with a shout, that was answered by those
who had been left behind.</p>

<p>When it was seen that they were bringing prisoners back
with them, Red and those who had remained at home with
the lame scout became thrilled with eagerness to hear the
full particulars. Of course the others were just as ready
to relate all that had occurred, and for some time the
clatter of tongues would have made one believe he must be
somewhere in the neighborhood of the Tower of Babel.</p>

<p>Mr. Garrabrant realized that they were dealing with a
pair of hard citizens, and he was resolved to leave nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
undone looking to their remaining prisoners. So he personally
looked to their bonds before lying down, in order
to make sure they could not break loose.</p>

<p>A double guard was to be stationed on this night, because
of the unusual conditions existing. It would be too
bad, after all their trouble, should any accident occur
whereby these men regained their freedom.</p>

<p>So when the camp quieted down finally, there were just
four boys stationed at certain points, and with orders to
keep the fire burning brilliantly all the time. The balance
"slept on their arms," as Lil Artha called it&mdash;that is, they
kept those handy cudgels close beside them, where they
could be readily found in case a sudden need arose for their
services. Because Mr. Garrabrant could not be entirely
positive that the two prisoners did not have friends of
a like character somewhere up here in the wilderness, who
might attempt their rescue.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE THINGS THAT MAKE BOYS MANLY.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Garrabrant</span> laid his plans during the night, and
when morning came he announced them to his boys.</p>

<p>"I shall take these two men down to Rockaway to-day,"
he said, "and deliver them over to the authorities. Ginger
will accompany me, and between us we can pull the boat
up the current again, starting possibly in the morning.
If we arrive there in good time, I may get a car and drive
over to Hickory Ridge, for there are several things I
ought to see about, that slipped my mind before."</p>

<p>"And if you happen to see anybody who asks about us,
sir, just tell them we're getting along dandy," declared
Lil Artha.</p>

<p>"So say we all of us," sang out several others of the
scouts.</p>

<p>"Tell my folks they were poor prophets," remarked Jasper
Merriweather.</p>

<p>"In what way, my boy?" inquired the scout master;
though, truth to tell, he could give a pretty good guess.</p>

<p>"Oh! ma, she said she'd give me one night to stay away;
and pa, he told her that two would see my finish. But here
we're going on our first week, and I'm feeling just fine.
Not a bit homesick, tell 'em, Mr. Garrabrant, please. And
bound to stay the whole ten days, or bust."</p>

<p>"Good for you, Jasper, old top!" laughed Lil Artha,
patting the real tenderfoot encouragingly on the back.</p>

<p>"And Mr. Garrabrant," put in Ty Collins, who was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
pretty good "feeder" as some of the other boys often remarked,
"don't you think you might pick up a little more
grub while you have the chance. You see, we didn't
count on so many mouths to feed while we were up here,
and the way that stuff is disappearing is sure a caution.
I know, because I do a lot of the cooking, you see, sir."</p>

<p>"Why, yes, Tyrus, I had that on my mind," laughed the
jovial scout master. "And we'll try and find room in the
boat for a nice ham, some bacon, and a few more things
that boys like. I guess I'm a good provider, taken on the
whole. You see, we didn't count on feeding Abe Morris
and his family, or these two gentlemen here, besides the
frolicsome monkey that has taken a fancy for our eatables.
If I happen to run across Colonel Hitchens I shall let
him know we've got an eye out for his runaway pet."</p>

<p>The two men were allowed to eat breakfast, one at a
time, and Mr. Garrabrant and Ginger stood over them
while the operation of feeding was in progress. Much as
both of the desperadoes might have liked to attempt flight,
they lacked the nerve to start trouble when those two stalwart
men were within reach. And so, although they
scowled and muttered, they made no resistance when they
were tied up again.</p>

<p>Mr. Garrabrant had found quite a nice little assortment
of deadly weapons upon the pair, which he had confiscated.
These he meant to take along with him, not feeling safe
in leaving such things in camp, where several of the boys
were quite unaccustomed to handling firearms, and some
accident might ensue, for which he would be responsible.</p>

<p>Although no one suspected it until they heard the click
of his shutter, Mark had managed to snap off the entire
outfit as they stood there, assisting Mr. Garrabrant load
his prisoners into the boat.</p>

<p>And it might be taken for granted that the official photographer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
of the camp had seized upon an opportunity
when the two prisoners' faces were in full view, so that no
one could afterwards reasonably doubt their claim to having
captured the desperate men so long wanted by the Rockaway
authorities.</p>

<p>Of course the camp was left in full charge of the assistant
scout master, Elmer Chenowith, with a parting injunction
from Mr. Garrabrant that the boys were to render
his representative just as much respect as though it were
himself.</p>

<p>There could be no doubt about that being done, since
Elmer was a universal favorite among his fellows, and had
hardly an enemy in all Hickory Ridge.</p>

<p>"I reckon, suh, we can manage to get along all right
while you are away," Chatz Maxfield had called out reassuringly,
after the boat had left the landing, with Ginger
working industriously at the oars, the two prisoners
huddled amidships, and the scout master seated astern,
where he could keep his eye pretty much all the time on
the slippery customers.</p>

<p>"If I wasn't positive about that, Charles, I'd never be
leaving you," was what Mr. Garrabrant replied, as he
waved his hand to them.</p>

<p>Presently the fast-moving boat swept around a bend, and
was lost to view. Several of the boys sighed a little, and
looked a bit downcast. Despite their assumption of freedom
from homesickness they could not help feeling that
their leader would perhaps be in "dear old Hickory
Ridge" that afternoon, and might even pass by their beloved
homes, which it seemed they had not seen for an
age.</p>

<p>Of course Elmer, who had roved more or less, was not in
this class. He knew better than to make fun of them, however.
Between himself and Mark they had many a quiet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
laugh over the way the fellows made out to be so free from
care.</p>

<p>"I bet you it seems like a coon's age to some of them
since they said good-by to mother and father," Mark managed
to remark, as they stood there watching the rest gaze
down river after the vanished link that was to bind them
with civilization.</p>

<p>"Sure it does," Elmer had agreed. "Do you know
that little story about the kid who ran away from home,
and what an eternity it seemed to him?"</p>

<p>"I don't seem to remember," replied the other. "What
happened, Elmer?"</p>

<p>"Why, he spent the day of his life, you know. He had
made up his mind in the beginning that he would never
come back. Then at noon he determined that a whole month
would give his folks a good scare. The afternoon hung on
terribly. Minutes seemed hours, and at last he just
couldn't stand it any longer. He had spent his last penny,
but it was getting night, and he had never been without a
home in the dark before."</p>

<p>"Yes, I can understand that, because once I did it too,"
laughed Mark; "but don't mind me, Elmer, go right along
with the story. What happened to him?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. That's where the fun came in," replied the
other. "You see his folks understood that kid, and they
just made up their minds to punish him by not paying
the slightest attention to him. So he came sneaking into
the sitting room where dad was reading the paper, and
mom was knitting. Neither of them even looked at him.
He thought that mighty queer, when he had expected to
be hugged and kissed and cried over like one who had been
lost a year.</p>

<p>"After a long time, when he had coughed, and moved
about without either of them paying the slightest attention<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
to him, the boy was struck with an idea. He would
say something that <i>must</i> make them realize the near calamity
that had happened. So he bent down to stroke the back
of the old tabby that was purring by the fire, and he
says, says he:</p>

<p>"'Oh! I see you still have the same old cat you used
to have when I was home!'"</p>

<p>Mark burst into a hearty laugh.</p>

<p>"I get the point, Elmer, all right, and I guess it applies
to a few of our fellows, but on the whole they've acted
just fine. A better bunch of good-hearted boys it would
be hard to find anywhere. And I tell you this outing's
going to do every mother's son of them a heap of good.
What they learn in this camp will pay a dozen times over
for the trouble it's taken. I hope Mr. Garrabrant gets
safely down to Rockaway with his boatload of human
freight. Perhaps there won't be a sensation in Hickory
Ridge when the news gets out that the Boy Scouts captured
those bad men, and sent them to the police of Rockaway
with their compliments. I guess that's going some
for a new organization of tenderfeet scouts, eh?"</p>

<p>"I should say yes," replied the young scout leader, emphatically.
"And after all, we've only got one more mystery
to solve to have the slate clear."</p>

<p>"You mean about that monkey business, I suppose?"
suggested Mark.</p>

<p>"Yes; and possibly we may be lucky enough to have
that settled before Mr. Garrabrant comes back again,"
Elmer remarked, confidently.</p>

<p>"You think then we are due for another visit from
Diablo, say to-night?"</p>

<p>"It stands to reason," said Elmer, "that he will have
eaten up all those crackers long before then, and knowing
where we keep our supplies, you can count on him paying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
another call. So many around the camp in the daytime
will keep him shy. You remember there were only Ginger
and Red at home all day, when he was here before."</p>

<p>"All right," remarked his chum. "We'll try and have
a warm reception ready for our friend Diablo. He's apt
to be the most surprised monkey ever, once he hits that
trigger; what with the loop snatching him up in the air,
the flashlight going off with a great dazzling glow, and
the yells of the boys as they get on to the racket. I just
hope it turns out a good picture. It'll sure be the star
of the whole collection. What?"</p>

<p>Elmer took charge, and proceeded to start the ball rolling.
They were not intending to have any strenuous work
while the scout master was away, but some of them coaxed
Elmer to give a few exhibitions of throwing a rope, and
doing some other little tricks that he had learned while up
on that Canada cattle farm.</p>

<p>He also went deeper into the track business, and the
boys were so anxious to learn all they could about this fascinating
study, that they all spent hours trying to find new
footprints so that they could drag Elmer thither, and get
him to tell the sort of little animal that had made them,
what his habits were, and all about him.</p>

<p>Then after lunch some words brought up the subject of
picture writing. Elmer had more or less to say about that,
for he had been among the Indians, and copied any amount
of their queer methods of communicating.</p>

<p>"It's just as simple as falling off a log, fellows," he said.
"If a little kid were trying to make you understand that
three men had gone down river in a boat, if he had any
sense at all he'd draw a canoe with three figures in it holding
paddles. A rock sticking up would have something that
looked like foam on one side. That would tell you the water
was running so, and that the canoe was going <i>down</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the river. If they were being pursued, in the boat behind
a figure would be firing a gun. Then they escape, for they
go ashore and make a fire. All got away, for there are
still three of them. And that's the easy way it goes. It just
can't be too simple. A child might read it. And that's
Indian picture writing. Now, suppose some of you try it.
If anybody can read it right off the reel, then you've made
a success of the job. But remember, this isn't any rebus
or puzzle."</p>

<p>So for some time the boys employed themselves in practicing
this simple art, under the directions of the young
scout master. They found it lots of fun, and of course
there was more or less shouting over some of the wonderful
pictures drawn, which the artists themselves could
hardly designate, after their work became cold.</p>

<p>Dr. Ted and Mark had gone off with some more food, to
find out how Abe and his family were, after the exciting
experience of the preceding day, and to tell them that their
unwelcome visitors were by that time safely locked up in
the Rockaway strong box.</p>

<p>Mark wished to get a few pictures of the two "kids"
in their native woods. They would not look the same after
they reached civilization, where kindly women would only
too willingly take them in hand, and fit them out with new
clothes.</p>

<p>Toby fairly haunted the spot where the balloon lay in
a heap, just as they had piled it up. Doubtless the boy was
indulging himself with castles in the air connected with
the time to come, in the dim future, when he too might
have a chance to fly through the clouds in one of these big
gas bags, or with a modern aeroplane, which would of
course be much better.</p>

<p>And so the day wore on.</p>

<p>As evening approached some of the boys mentally pictured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Mr. Garrabrant talking with the good people of
Hickory Ridge, and in each case it was a father or mother
who so proudly heard what wonderful progress the boy
was making in learning to take care of himself when left
to his own resources.</p>

<p>Things went on as usual. They had plenty of trout for
supper, of which dainty the scouts seemed never to tire.
Then a huge mess of rice had been boiled, which, served
with sugar and condensed milk, proved a good dessert. But
before that was reached they had a stew made of tinned
beef, Boston baked beans and some corn, while Ty Collins
showed his skill as a flapjack maker by turning out several
heaps of pretty fair pancakes.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of the scouts ate more heavily of these last
than they should, for it was noted that at various times
during the night a boy here or there would get to talking
in his sleep, and show signs of restlessness that could only
come from indigestion. Nevertheless, when the time came
for retiring, Elmer gave the signal for taps to be sounded
on the bugle, as Lil Artha declared, "everything was
lovely, and the goose hung high!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>HOW THE TRAP WORKED.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> they turned in after the rest, Elmer and his
closest chum, Mark, spent a little time doing something mysterious
over in the vicinity of the tent in which the extra
stores were kept.</p>

<p>The boys understood that it had more or less connection
with the expected visit of the liberty-loving monkey, Diablo,
but like good scouts they minded their own business.</p>

<p>Everyone had been warned to keep away from that same
tent under penalty of being given the surprise of their lives,
and of a most unpleasant nature at that. Of course, no one
knew exactly what the scout leader had arranged; but all
the same they felt positive it would meet the peculiar emergency.
And each boy made up his mind that during his
term as sentry nothing could induce him to saunter near that
marked territory.</p>

<p>A tall and vigorous young hickory sapling had by accident
started on its way toward some day becoming the king
of the woods right there in front of the tent opening. And
Elmer, quick to grasp the opportunities which fortune threw
at his feet, had made use of this same healthy and sound
young tree. From time of old he knew the value of hickory
when one wanted a particularly springy bow.</p>

<p>He and Mark were panting a little when they finished a
certain little job which doubtless had a bearing on the game.
And strange to say, the upright hickory sapling no longer
pointed toward the beckoning sky; but stood there with
bowed head in meek subjection to the will of man.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>"Think the trigger will run smooth enough?" queried
Mark, as they stood back to gaze at the evidence of their
handiwork.</p>

<p>"I've greased it!" chuckled Elmer. "That's what they
do out West when a big bear trap is used, and there's danger
of the thing holding too well. Do you want to step inside
this loop, and give it a try, Mark?"</p>

<p>"Please excuse me this time, old fellow," laughed the
other. "I'm very well satisfied to stand on the earth as
I am just now, and don't hanker about getting any nearer
the clouds. I leave all that ambition to others, and particularly
animals used to climbing trees. How about the rest of
the tent, Elmer?"</p>

<p>"Pegged down so solid that a mouse would have trouble
crawling under," came the immediate and confident response.</p>

<p>"That means if our friend Diablo is as hungry as we
believe, and is determined to make another of his raids on
our grub, he's just <i>got</i> to take advantage of the open door,
eh, Elmer?"</p>

<p>"That's just what he does," replied the scout leader.
"And we're going to get him one way or the other, going
or coming. If he happens to miss getting caught as he trips
into the tent, he won't be so lucky when he comes out. You
see, at that time he's apt to have his arms full of the things
we left around loose. He's greedy, like all monkeys, and
will try to carry as much he can. Then he can't see quite
so well where to step. Flip! bang! and there you are! Lil
Artha hit it closer than he thought when he said everything
was lovely and the goose hung high! We expect <i>our</i> goose
to do just that same thing."</p>

<p>"Huh! I guess this is what they call putting your foot
in it, eh, Elmer?" chuckled Mark.</p>

<p>"We hope it will be, that's right. But as everything has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
been done to a turn, don't you think we'd better hunt out
our blankets? Perhaps Diablo may be watching us right
now, crazy to get started on his raid. And then again, it
may be he's far away from here to-night, and we'll find
we've had all our trouble for our pains."</p>

<p>"But you don't think that last, honest now, Elmer?"
queried Mark.</p>

<p>"If I did I wouldn't have gone to all the trouble I did,"
returned the other. "Take one last look over your camera,
and the flashlight powder cartridge. All O. K. is it? Then
let's leave here, and trust to luck for the rest."</p>

<p>"I don't believe I'll get much sleep, for expecting to hear
a racket!" Mark declared, as they walked conspicuously
away from the vicinity of the store tent, so that the keen-eyed
monkey would see them, if, as they suspected, Diablo
were hiding somewhere close by, waiting for his chance to
make another descent on the camp where all those delicious
dainties were kept, to which he had grown accustomed during
the period of his captivity&mdash;and liberty without these
could not be proving all it was cracked up to be.</p>

<p>"Oh! I wouldn't let a little thing like this keep me
awake," said Elmer.</p>

<p>"Well, you see it's different with me," declared his
chum. "I've had almost no experience in such exciting
things, while you have been through rafts of it. But honest
now, I'm hoping that our little game pans out a success.
I've laid that big bag where we can grab it up on the run,
and I saw you fixing the ropes handy. Let Mr. Diablo just
give that loop a tiny jerk when he gets his hind foot in it,
and oh! my, won't he be the worst rattled jabberer ever!"</p>

<p>Now, secretly Elmer himself was in quite a little flutter
of excitement; but he knew how to hold himself in check
better than did Mark. He calmly arranged his blanket as
usual, and then settled himself down as though such a thing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
as being aroused in the middle of the night were unthought
of.</p>

<p>And having practiced the control of his powers he did go
to sleep very shortly; absolutely refusing to allow his mind
to become active by dwelling on any subject that might agitate
him.</p>

<p>Silence came upon the camp.</p>

<p>The fire sparkled and crackled as from time to time one
of the sentries stepped over to toss fresh fuel upon it. But
acting under orders, they refrained religiously from ever
passing near the store tent.</p>

<p>If one of them chanced to be particularly vigilant, he must
have discovered a shadowy figure that came slipping down
from the branches of a tree that grew not a dozen feet away
from the apparently abandoned tent.</p>

<p>It made not the least noise, which would seem to indicate
that it must possess feet shod with velvet; but crouching
low, after a suspicious look around, started toward the depot
of supplies.</p>

<p>Passing around this tent, sniffing at various places, and
apparently seeking a means of entrance, the dusky figure
finally came to the front, where that small opening stood so
very invitingly in view.</p>

<p>Elmer, sleeping soundly, was suddenly awakened by a terrific
screech, angry and vehement; immediately succeeded by
the shrillest scolding and chattering he had ever heard.</p>

<p>Throwing aside his blanket, he started to crawl out of the
tent. Mark was at his heels, laughing for all he was worth,
and chortling:</p>

<p>"It worked, Elmer, the trap went off! We've got him, I
guess, all right! Great guns; just listen to the racket he's
making, will you? Oh! hurry! hurry! before all the blood
runs to his head!"</p>

<p>It was only his great impatience that made him imagine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Elmer dallied; for to tell the truth, the scout leader emerged
from that tent in double-quick time.</p>

<p>Both of them "scooted" for the spot where all that row
was sounding; no other word would so fully describe the
manner of their progress as well as Lil Artha's favorite expression.</p>

<p>They were not alone in this forward rush. From every
tent came creeping figures, as the scouts crawled forth. And
by degrees the screeching of the monkey was actually
drowned in the greater clamor of boyish shouts.</p>

<p>It seemed almost as though Pandemonium must have
broken loose in that camp of the Hickory Ridge Boy Scouts,
for a dozen pair of sturdy young lungs can make considerable
noise once they break loose.</p>

<p>It was a ridiculous spectacle that greeted them as they
reached the store tent. The bent-over hickory sapling had
sprung obediently erect as soon as the shooting of the trigger
had released it from the crotch in which its apex had been
gripped. And swaying back and forth, attempting all manner
of high gymnastics, was a grotesque figure that stretched
out its arms, and made frantic efforts to reach the body of
the sapling, so as to climb up.</p>

<p>"Get the bag, Elmer!" cried Mark, the second that he
arrived.</p>

<p>But already had the scout leader snatched that article up
and prepared to clap it around the struggling monkey, taking
care to avoid being caught by those waving hands.</p>

<p>"Quick! the rope!" he gasped, after he had made a forward
movement, enclosing the gyrating body in the stout
sack.</p>

<p>Mark knew what he was doing, and in a brief time, during
which the rest of the boys stood around watching in
wonder, the struggling monkey was secured.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here, Toby, hold this rope end for a minute!" called
Mark.</p>

<p>The other was only too willing to obey, for it gave him
a chance to say he had had a hand in the great capture of
the hairy thief. Ten seconds later there was a sudden brilliant
flash that caused some of the scouts to cry out, in the
belief that a storm had crept upon them, with the lightning
giving advance warning of its coming.</p>

<p>"It's Mark, and he took a snap flashlight picture of the
crowd standing around in pajamas!" cried Lil Artha.
"Oh! my, what a sight that will be to chase away the blues.
If only my red stripes show, I'll be the happy one."</p>

<p>"How about the first flash&mdash;did it go off when the monk
pulled the trigger, Mark?" demanded Elmer.</p>

<p>"Sure it did," broke in Tom Cropsey, who had been one
of the sentries on duty at the time; "and gave me a nasty
scare. I never dreamed you had fixed things up that way,
Elmer; and at first I thought something had exploded. But
what can we do with the critter, now that we've got him?"</p>

<p>"Oh! that's all fixed," laughed Mark. "Elmer made a
stout collar which can be fastened around his neck so he
just can't get it off. To that a rope is fastened, and Mr.
Diablo will amuse the camp with his stunts the rest of the
time we stay up here on old Lake Solitude. Ready to work
it, Elmer?"</p>

<p>"Yes, give me a hand here, please," replied the scout
leader, who had been cautiously taking the enmeshed body
of the still struggling monkey down from the straightened
hickory sapling.</p>

<p>"Why, here's luck!" exclaimed Elmer, presently. "As
sure as you live he's got a collar on right now, with a ring
for a rope. There's a trailing foot of stuff fastened to it,
showing just how he got away. All I have to do is to tie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
our stout line to that ring so even the clever fingers of
a monkey can't unfasten it."</p>

<p>When this was done, and the other end of the rope made
fast to the sapling that had assisted in Diablo's downfall,
by degrees the rope encircling the beast was removed, and
then the bag. The prisoner was inclined to be a little
savage at first, because his taste of freedom had made him
somewhat wild, and besides, these were all strangers to
him.</p>

<p>But he was very hungry, and upon being offered food
seized it eagerly. After that they would have very little
trouble with Diablo, though he proved to be a treacherous
rascal, and pinched more than a few of the boys who ventured
to be too familiar with him.</p>

<p>The scouts were ordered back to their blankets, and once
again did the camp relapse into silence, save for the grunting
of the satisfied Diablo, as he continued to feast upon the
sweet cakes with which he had been supplied.</p>

<p>In this manner, then, was the last source of trouble laid
low. Ghosts and thieves they had encountered, but in the
end success had rewarded their efforts, and it began to look
as though the balance of their stay in camp might be more
in the nature of a picnic than the first few days and nights
had proven.</p>

<p>When morning came the boys were early astir, and
crowded around to stare at the prisoner. But with his
stomach comfortably filled Diablo was lazy and good natured.
He refused to be bothered, and curled up on the
ground like a dog, made out to sleep, though a careful
examination might have disclosed the fact that one eye was
partly open, and as soon as a boy entered the store tent he
was on his feet, begging.</p>

<p>But Ginger would be the one who must feel the most satisfaction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
over the capture, for it would ease his mind concerning
the necessity for cutting his stay on the earth short,
and accompanying the Evil One in a "chariot of fire."</p>

<p>So that day passed very slowly as they awaited the coming
of the scout master and his "ebony galley slave" who
was to row the boat up-stream.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE LAST FLICKERING CAMP FIRE DIES OUT.</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">There's</span> the outpost making signals, Elmer," said
Mark, about three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Two of the scouts, who were pretty well up in wigwag
work, had been dispatched to a knob part way up the mountain,
from which a fine view of the lower lake could be
obtained, as well as the zigzag course of the connecting
Paradise Creek.</p>

<p>"Looks like they must have sighted our scout master,
then," declared Elmer, as he left what he was engaged in
doing to hasten over to where the balance of the signal
flags lay.</p>

<p>Snatching one up he began to wave it in certain eccentric
movements which Red Huggins, who held the book, knew
to be a query as to what the outposts or videttes had discovered.</p>

<p>"There! he's starting to answer. Everybody watch
sharp, and write down what you make it!" exclaimed the
scout leader.</p>

<p>Pencils and paper had been made ready, though most of
the scouts carried small note books in which they entered
such things as they wished to preserve.</p>

<p>For some little time they watched each deliberate motion
of the distant waving flag, no one saying a word.
When finally the sign was given that the message had
reached its end, every scout started to scribble at hot speed.</p>

<p>Then Elmer walked along the line, examining the various
records.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pretty well done," he said after he had completed his
examination, "but of course it was the easiest of tests, for
we all felt sure the report would be that they were in sight.
They are crossing Jupiter Lake right now. That means
they will be with us inside of an hour and a half, for Ginger
is rowing stoutly, Matty says, and Mr. Eggleston seems to
be getting ready to take the second pair of oars himself for
the pull up Paradise Creek, which you may remember is
no cinch, fellows."</p>

<p>"That's right," declared Larry Billings, rubbing his
arm, the muscles of which had been more or less sore ever
since that strain.</p>

<p>"It's going to be a long hour and a half," said Jasper
Merriweather.</p>

<p>"Oh! rats, just go and play with the monkey, to kill
time," laughed Lil Artha.</p>

<p>"I'm just wild to see what Ginger does when we take
him to meet his 'debble,'" observed Toby, who had of
course been hovering over that magical balloon pretty much
all the morning; indeed, so long as that was around they
could hardly get the ambitious amateur aviator to do anything
worth while.</p>

<p>"Somebody coming back yonder; I saw 'em flit past that
open place," remarked Nat Scott, pointing upward.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's Ted and Chatz, returning from the lone
cabin. They promised to be back early, because they didn't
want to miss the fun when Ginger came," declared the scout
leader.</p>

<p>Within the next half hour not only did Ted and his companion
arrive, but the two videttes and signal men reached
camp. Having discharged the duty to which they had been
assigned, Matty Eggleston and Jack Armitage had lost no
time in heading once more down the mountain.</p>

<p>Now an hour had gone, and the half was passing slowly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
All eyes were turned down the lake to the spot where the
creek began, anticipating seeing the boat shoot into view.</p>

<p>"Hurrah! there they come!" shouted one who had
climbed a tree, the better to get the first glimpse of the
returning couple.</p>

<p>As the boat slipped out on the silvery surface of the
lonely lake, so well named Solitude, the cheers that arose
must have been particularly pleasing to the young man
who was devoting so much of his time to the task of trying
to make the Hickory Ridge Boy Scouts the best troops
in the county.</p>

<p>But it was Ginger who deliberately dropped his oars,
to rise to his feet, and with his black hand over his heart,
make several salaams. He came near taking a header over
the side of the boat in his eagerness to return the compliments
which he really believed the boys were meaning for
him, at which of course there was an uproarious laugh all
around.</p>

<p>Then came the landing. Ty Collins made sure that the
boat contained a lot of packages, and his eyes shone with
pleasure as he saw that one of them bore the unmistakable
outlines of a whole ham.</p>

<p>"This way, Mr. Garrabrant, we've got a surprise for
you!" laughed Elmer.</p>

<p>"You come along, too, Ginger," called Lil Artha, "and
make the acquaintance of an old friend of yours. He's
been fretting like everything because you were so long getting
here. Diablo, here's Ginger coming to shake hands
with you!"</p>

<p>Of course they had heaps of fun watching the look on the
face of Ginger, as he found himself confronting the hairy
thief whom he had seen under such strange conditions, and
believed to be a visitor from a warm country where pitchforks
are said to be in fashion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>But it required considerable urging for Ginger to actually
take the extended hand of the big monkey. Eventually,
however, they became quite good friends. Ginger was forever
supplying the captive with tidbits, and on his part
Diablo seemed to recognize in the dark-skinned man a boon
companion.</p>

<p>Of course, after they had their little frolic, and the story
of Diablo's capture had been fully told, the boys were
eager to know whether Mr. Garrabrant had succeeded in
turning the two bad men over to the Rockaway authorities,
also if he had happened to run across any of their folks
while in Hickory Ridge.</p>

<p>"Make your minds easy, boys," he had replied, laughingly.
"Jim and Bill are safely lodged behind the bars in
Rockaway jail. I saw Colonel Hitchens, and he paid me
the reward that was offered for their capture, which goes
to the troop. Later on you boys shall take a vote as to
what to do with the money, though I imagine I can give
a pretty good guess where it'll go from what I heard you
say before about Abe and his kiddies."</p>

<p>"Did you happen to mention the fact that we believed
we had his runaway monkey up here as a neighbor, sir?"
asked Elmer.</p>

<p>"I certainly did, and he at once declared that if you
could only manage to get hold of that rogue, Diablo, it
would be another hundred dollars reward," answered the
scout master.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" cried Lil Artha, boisterously, "but the
honor goes to Elmer and Mark. They not only did the
entire trick, but managed to get a flashlight picture of the
monkey going up in the air, with one of his hind legs
gripped in the loop of a rope. It's the greatest thing I
ever heard about! Wait till you see the picture, sir."</p>

<p>"But how about Hickory Ridge, sir; I suppose it's still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
on the map?" asked Elmer, who knew only too well that
every fellow was just dying to hear whether the scout
master had happened to run across any of their home folks,
and what they had said in sending word.</p>

<p>"Well," replied Mr. Garrabrant, with a smile and a
nod around; "I've got a pleasant surprise for you all.
Having some time on my hands after I had carried out
my little business affairs, I just thought it would be nice
if I took my car and ran around to the home of every scout
who is in camp here on old Solitude!"</p>

<p>"Bully for you, sir!"</p>

<p>"That was mighty fine of you, Mr. Garrabrant, and did
you see my folks, sir?"</p>

<p>"Three cheers for our scout master, fellows; ain't he
all to the good, though?"</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Garrabrant knew boys and was not in the least
offended by such crude ways of expressing their appreciation.
He knew it sprang straight from the heart, and was
prouder to have won so lasting a place in their regard than
he would have been to take a city.</p>

<p>"Yes, I saw the folks of every lad, and bear messages
that will please you, I am sure," he observed. "Here they
are, just as they were sent by mothers and fathers. And
you may be sure they were delighted to learn how well
things were going. They want you to stay your time out,
and come back, ruddy and brown, better fitted to take up
your school duties when vacation ends."</p>

<p>After the packet of little hastily scribbled messages had
been distributed, care having been taken by the thoughtful
scout master that not a single one might feel neglected,
there was a strange silence in camp. Undoubtedly several
of the boys were rather perilously near the breaking point,
as they began to once more experience the grip of that
terrible malady&mdash;homesickness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>But Mr. Garrabrant knew, and he it was who began to
play with the captive monkey, causing more or less sport,
that presently had all the boys laughing uproariously. And
so the threatened eruption was avoided. When supper time
came they had managed to recover their former steadiness
of purpose to stick it out to the end.</p>

<p>But there was not a single member of the troop who did
not treasure that little slip of paper, bearing only a few
cheering loving words in a familiar hand, during the rest
of the stay in camp.</p>

<p>As to what else befell the Hickory Ridge Boy Scouts, and
particularly those members of the Wolf Patrol in whom
we have had especial interest, time and space will not allow
my attempting to narrate here. Later on the opportunity
will doubtless arise, so that we shall once more make their
acquaintance, and accompany them on other fields of outdoor
life, where they continue to imbibe the secrets of Nature
that are calculated to make them better fitted to take
care of themselves, and be of service to their fellows.</p>

<p>No serious calamity came to pass as the days slipped
along. They continued to take toll of the obliging trout
that dwelt in Lake Solitude, long acquainted with the hooks
and devices of civilized man. And Mr. Garrabrant seldom
allowed even a single day to pass without endeavoring to
foster in his boys the manly spirit all American lads should
possess.</p>

<p>The day before they expected to break camp a party
went over to the cabin of Abe Morris and brought him
back with them, he being so far recovered, thanks to the
treatment of the proud amateur physician, Dr. Ted, that
he could limp, with the aid of crutches, and the stout as
well as willing arms of the boys to lean upon.</p>

<p>Of course the manly boy, Felix, and the useful maiden,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Little Lou, came along, for the hut was being abandoned
forever.</p>

<p>They had places in the boats when the camp was left behind.
The wagon as well as a carriage awaited them at
exactly the same place where had burned the first camp
fire of the expedition, this latter being for the use of Abe
and his "kiddies," and the clumsier vehicle for the camp
luggage.</p>

<p>As for the scouts themselves they scorned such a means of
travel. Browned and healthy, they felt able to walk
twice the seven miles that lay between the Sweetwater and
Hickory Ridge. And besides, were they not headed for
<i>home</i>, with all that that implied in their enthusiastic boyish
hearts?</p>

<p>We could not, even if we would lift the veil, betray
the emotion some of the valiant scouts exhibited when
clasped again in the loving arms of a mother or a father.
But everybody declared that the change in the boys was
wonderful, and that they really seemed to have taken a
great step forward in the journey toward manliness. Jasper
Merriweather in particular hardly seemed like the same
weak, timid boy. He had drawn in a big breath of "outdoors,"
and glimpsed the goal toward which he was now
determined to set his course.</p>

<p>And in Hickory Ridge that night, there was a consensus
of opinion to the effect that the Boy Scout movement was
by long odds the best thing that had ever happened to
quicken the better element lying dormant in every growing
lad.</p>

<p>Abe Morris was easily placed in a paying position, and
the boys never lost their interest in the boy Felix and
Little Lou. Just as they had declared, the rewards coming
to them for having effected the capture of the two bad men,
as well as the runaway monkey valued so highly by Colonel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Hitchens, were paid over to Abe, and went toward starting
the little Morris family in a cottage of their own within
the limits of the town of Hickory Ridge.</p>

<p>Doubtless the thoughts of those lads would many times
go out to the camp fires which had marked their first outing
after organizing. And as they looked over the numerous
fine pictures Mark had secured, they would live again
the days when they experienced the strenuous life under
canvas.</p>

<p>More Alger books are sold and they are more popular

character, clean, manly tone and the wholesome lessons
they teach without being goody-goody, make Alger
books as acceptable to the parents as to the boys. The

<div class='center'><i>A STORY ABOUT BASEBALL</i><br />

By "CHRISTY" MATHEWSON<br />

(<span class='small'>FAMOUS PITCHER Of THE NEW YORK NATIONAL LEAGUE BASEBALL TEAM</span>)<br />

<span class='small'>(Copyrighted, 1910, by the R. J. Bodmer Co.)</span></div>


<p>The characters are college boys in everything but their ability to play
baseball. Each represents one of the leading players who are now
playing in the American and National Leagues with names slightly
changed, but the reader will soon discover that he is reading the early
exploits of one of his baseball favorites.</p>

<p>The whole range of interesting features about a ball team and the
game itself is covered in successive chapters. One of them contains
the secrets of what is known as "inside baseball" and "signal work"
with illustrations showing how to do it.</p>

<p>Through the twenty chapters are interwoven many of the stories of
actual plays, famous catches, thrilling episodes of games, tricks pulled
off and some that did not work, which have come within the author's
experience.</p>

<p>A good story of college life runs through the book. The hero gets
into trouble and his friends get him out in the usual strenuous style
of college life stories.</p>

<p>It is a live book about baseball, with live characters, and written by the
one man who knows more about the men who are playing it to-day and
the methods by which games are won than anyone else in the sport.</p>

<p>"EDITOR'S NOTE&mdash;The Daily News makes no apology for placing
in this position of honor on the first page the opening chapters of a
serial story dealing with baseball events and baseball heroes.</p>

<p>"The Daily News believes in clean athletic sports, believes in encouraging
them and in keeping them clean. Baseball is the national game. It
is not only the most popular sport in the United States, but it is national
in the sense that it expresses the ingenuity, the energy and the agility of
the typical American. Viewed in this light, baseball possesses a dignity
of its own and an entertaining and informing piece of literary work about
it cannot be trivial. What is elevating, what is interesting, and what is
dignified cannot but make a strong appeal to the appreciation of every
reader."&mdash;<i><b>The Chicago News, March 21, 1910.</b></i></p>

<p>"The best baseball story ever written."&mdash;<i><b>The Evening World,
New York, N. Y., March 14, 1910.</b></i></p>

<p>"I have read WON IN THE NINTH with much interest and it
has been very entertaining."&mdash;<i><b>Charles W. Murphy, President
Chicago National League Baseball Club, Chicago, April 8, 1910.</b></i></p>

<p>"WON IN THE NINTH is a great book, and one that every lover
of the game should read."&mdash;<i><b>Charles A. Comiskey, President
Chicago White Sox American League Baseball Club, Chicago,
April 7, 1910.</b></i></p>

posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
